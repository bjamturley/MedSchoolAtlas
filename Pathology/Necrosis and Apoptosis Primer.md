Pathology is the study of disease.

**Etiology:** Study of the cause of disease
**Pathogenesis:** Study of development of disease
**Morphogenic changes:** Changes in structure of tissue or organ
**Clinical manifestations:** Signs/symptoms of disease
# Cellular Adaptation
## Hypertrophy
The increase in the size of a cell and its organ. It occurs in **non-mitotically active** cells (e.g. muscle). It can be both natural (like the uterine wall increasing in size with pregnancy) or pathologic (enlargement of the heart from hypertension).

**Etiology**: Increased workload or increased stimulation
## Hyperplasia
The increase in the number of cells. Can lead to increase in organ size. It occurs in **mitotically active** cells (e.g. epithelial). It can be both natural (**lactational changes in breasts**) or pathologic (**benign prostatic hyperplasia**).

**Etiology:** Increased hormonal tone or compensatory. Can be the result of growth factors, more receptors, or stem cell activation.
## Atrophy
Decrease in the size of the cell and its organ. Can be both natural (especially in development) or pathologic.

**Etiology:** Decreased workload (disuse), denervation, low blood supply, or decreased hormonal tone. The process occurs using the lysosomal and ubiquitin/proteasome pathway to degrade cellular machinery.
## Metaplasia
For more on neoplasia, see here: [[Neoplasia Primer]].

The reprogramming of stem cells, replacing cells which are better adapted to a stressor. This generally occurs in [[Histological Techniques, Epithelium, and Glands#Epithelium|epithelial tissues]] in which columnar cells become squamous cells and vice versa. This is more often pathologic and can progress to **dysplasia** (alteration of cell structure) and eventually cancer. For example, **Barrett's esophagus** can progress to adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.

**Etiology:** Irritation or persistent stress, such as gastric acid (Barrett's esophagus) or from tobacco smoke.
# Necrosis
Tissue death. You'll see increased more red/pink staining (eosinophilia), calcification, and nuclear modifications.

*Nuclear shrinkage (pyknosis) → Nuclear fragmentation (karyorrhexis) → Nuclear
dissolution (karyolysis)*

# Apoptosis
Caspases (cytosolic proteases) lead to cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, membrane blebbing, and formation of apoptotic bodies. These are phagocytosed.
## Intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway
Will be triggered by loss of survival signals, DNA damage, and accumulation of misfolded proteins. **Caspases** will activate proteases and endonucleases to increase apoptosis.

*Regulation*
- **BCL-2**: Reduce mitochondrial pores → reduce release of Cytochrome C → **reduce apoptosis**
- **BAX/BAK**: Form membrane pores → release Cytochrome C → **increase apoptosis**

Inactivation of BCL-2 is part of the intrinsic pathway.
## Extrinsic (death receptor) pathway
Ligand mechanism: **FasL binds Fas** or **TNF-alpha binds TNFR**
Immune cell mechanism: Cytotoxic T-cell releases **perforin** and **granzyme B**

| Adjacent inflammation | Yes                                   | No                |
| Normal or pathologic? | Generally pathologic                  | Generally normal  | 
# Cellular Accumulation
Can occur with inadequate removal via transport mechanisms, issues with degradation, or deposition of exogenous substance without the transport/degradation machinery.

- Lipid accumulations: Can be both normal and pathologic
- Protein accumulations: Can be both normal and pathologic
- Pigment accumulations: Endogenous (lipofuscin, melanin, hemosiderin or iron), exogenous (carbon, tattoos)
# Calcification
## Dystrophic
Results in Ca2+ deposition in **diseased tissues** only, causing necrosis and tumors. The serum Ca2+ levels will be normal in this case.
## Metastatic
Results in Ca2+ deposition in **normal tissues** around the body. The serum Ca2+ levels will usual be abnormal (hypercalcemia)
