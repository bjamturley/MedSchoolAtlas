# Hemorrhage
## Coronary Artery
This is a normal artery.

## Bruises (Purpura)
Typically seen here as 2-3cm patches. The rest if typical ecchymosis.

![[Pasted image 20231105011726.png]]
## Bruises (Petechiae) - Heart surface
Small, pinpoint bleeds.

![[Pasted image 20231105011817.png]]
## Hemopericardium
Large hemorrhage causing blood to accumulate and become trapped in the pericardial sac around the heart. **Cardiac Tamponade** is a life-threatening condition from increased pressure from fluid accumulation making it difficult for the heart to pump.

## Subarachnoid Hemorrhage
Can occur in any age group often from abnormalities of blood vessels.

## Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage
Viewing a **hemorrhagic stroke**. The exact location of this is often associated with **hypertension**.

## Intraventricular Hemorrhage (fetal brain)
A **germinal matrix bleed** from a **hypoperfusion event**. This area is highly vascularized, leaving it vulnerable in fetal development. Complication sometimes seen in **pre-term babies**.

# Thrombosis
## Coronary Artery Thrombosis
A thrombus in the **left anterior descending artery** causing a **myocardial infarction**.

![[Pasted image 20231105012321.png]]

A higher magnification view. Thrombus likely formed from **atherosclerotic
plaque**.

![[Pasted image 20231105012410.png]]

Also a CAT, but this vessel has **complete occlusion**. Circular lumen is now a tight triangle due to atherosclerosis and plaque buildup.

## Thrombosis
All the **red stripes** are RBCs that have been caught in the thrombus. The **white/pale pink stripes** are the platelets and fibrin.

# Embolism
## Pulmonary Thromboembolism (Lung)
The pulmonary thromboembolism is lodged in a large pulmonary artery.

## Saddle embolism (lung)
Itâ€™s occluding both sides of the artery where it bifurcates. Yee Haw.

## Fat embolism
Often from bone marrow embolism of bone fracture. High mortality but rare.

![[Pasted image 20231105012942.png]]
## Amniotic fluid embolism
Amniotic fluid, containing hypercoagulative substances and fetal skin cells, enters maternal circulation after placental membrane tear and causes occlusion. Rare birthing complication.

## Small intestine

# DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION (DIC)
Widespread endothelial activation causing thrombi in capillary sized vessels.
## Lung
