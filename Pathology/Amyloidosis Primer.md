# What is Amyloidosis?
Amyloidosis is a group of disorders characterized by the extracellular deposition of [[Connective Tissue#Fibrous components|fibrillar]] proteins, leading to tissue atrophy and functional compromise. The core pathogenesis centers on abnormal protein folding and aggregation, often involving immune components. It is a spectrum of diseases unified by the commonality of similar protein deposits.
# Properties

## Physical
- **Fibrils**: Non-branching, indefinite length, 7.5-10.0 nm diameter.
- **Structure**: Cross beta-pleated sheet conformation.
## Chemical
- **Composition**: 95% fibril proteins, 5% glycoprotein (P component or SAP).
- **Variants**: 15 chemically distinct types, including AL, AA, TTR, beta2-microglobulin, beta-amyloid protein.
# Classification
- **Systemic**: Involves multiple organ systems.
- **Localized**: Limited to a single organ.
# Pathogenesis
- **Protein Instability**: Abnormally folded proteins tend to aggregate.
- **Proteolytic Cleavage**: Another pathway to abnormal protein structures.
# Tissue Damage
- **Pressure Atrophy**: Large protein deposits lead to loss of normal tissue.
- **Nutrient Exchange**: May be influenced or blocked.
- **Toxicity**: Speculative, includes oxidative stress, ion channel abnormalities, and membrane destruction.
# Pathologic Features
- **Kidney**: Mainly glomerular deposits.
- **Heart**: Subendocardial and myocardial deposits.
- **Liver**: Space of Disse and vasculature.
- **Other**: Tongue nodules, peripheral nerve deposits.
# Prognosis and Treatment
- **Prognosis**: Generally poor, especially in AL-associated disease with multiple myeloma.
- **Treatment**: Early diagnosis crucial; underlying disorder treatment can improve target organ conditions.
    - **Chemotherapy and/or Bone Marrow Transplantation**: For clonal plasma cell disorders.
    - **Anti-inflammatory Drugs**: For inflammatory disorders.
    - **Liver Transplantation**: For certain types with liver-produced mutant proteins.
# New Therapies
- **Protein Correction**: Aiming to stabilize unstable proteins.
- **Protease Identification**: Determining key proteases in pathogenesis.
- **Immunotherapy**: A novel approach.
