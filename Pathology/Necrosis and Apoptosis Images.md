**Steatosis**: Abnormal accumulation of fats within parenchymal cells
**Lipofuscin**: Pigmented granules in cells
**Heterophagy**: Taking up materials from the external environment

## Keratinized stratified squamous epithelium
Squamous cells sitting atop a basement membrane, with flat cells on top. The apical surface has keratin.
![[Pasted image 20231018170938.png]]
## Non-keratinizing squamous epithelium
This is from the esophagus. The basal layer has higher mitotic activity than the apical layers.
![[Pasted image 20231018171050.png]]
## Transitional uroepithelium
From the bladder.
![[Pasted image 20231018171126.png]]
## Glandular epithelium
From the stomach.
![[Pasted image 20231018171319.png]]
## Skeletal muscle
Cross striations between fibers.

## Smooth muscle

# Images of Atrophied Tissue
## Brain
This is cerebral atrophy in a patient with Alzheimer's disease, which will lead to cognitive issues. The gyri are narrowed and sulci widened toward the front. This is most likely to be seen in regions with **decreased blood supply** (**chronic ischemia**).
![[Pasted image 20231018171715.png]]
## Testis
Parenchymal tissue from the testis to the right has atrophied and is smaller and more fibrotic as a result. This can be caused by **vascular occlusion**, **hormonal imbalances**, **cryptorchidism** (**undescended testis**).
![[Pasted image 20231018171959.png]]
## Muscle
These muscles have some cells smaller than the others. This case is caused by **Denervation Atrophy (loss of nerve stimulation)**.

# Images of Tissues with Hyperplasia
## Prostate
While a normal prostate is 3-4 inches, the number of prostatic glands and stroma have increased here. This process is nodular (non-uniform) and makes it bumpy. This can be caused by **Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)**, which is common in older men and can cause urinary frequency/incontinence.
![[Pasted image 20231018172518.png]]

This is an example of prostate tissue which has normal looking cells, but there are simply way to many. An excess of glandular epithelium.
![[Pasted image 20231018172646.png]]
# Images of Tissues with Metaplasia
## Laryngeal epithelium
The cells at the right (pseudostratified columnar) are normal, but those on the left (squamous) have been exchanged for a more resilient cell type. This is commonly found in locations of irritation (GI or respiratory tract). This tissue comes from a **chronic smoker** and the patient may will lose cilia in this region.
![[Pasted image 20231018173104.png]]
## Esophageal mucosa
The cells on right (squamous) are normal, but those on the left (glandular, columnar) have been exchanged. This occurred from chronic irritation from **acid reflux**, and the **new cells developed in order to produce mucin for protection**. This presentation is called **Barrett's Esophagus**.
![[Pasted image 20231018173352.png]]
# Images of Tissue with Coagulative Necrosis
Note that in the brain, ischemia causes **liquefactive** necrosis rather than coagulative.
## Myocardium
This nuclei of this tissue is being lost and the cells are blending together. The lost nuclei causes cells to become eosinophilic. Inflammatory cells (neutrophils) are present. This is caused by **ischemia**.
![[Pasted image 20231018173754.png]]
## Adrenal Cortex
The pale tissue here has lost blood supply, also due to **ischemia**. Note the loss of nuclei.
![[Pasted image 20231018173915.png]]
# Images of Tissue with Liquefactive Necrosis
## Brain
There is a loss of blood supply here in the upper left from a **cerebral infarction (stroke)** which has cause an abscess (collection of pus, neutrophils, dead tissue, and fibrin). The neutrophils have triggered the enzymatic digestion.
![[Pasted image 20231018174134.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231018174200.png]]
## Lung
There are two abscesses in this image, on in each lobe. The white regions represent high density of neutrophils. This is a complication of **severe pneumonia** from virulent organisms (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus). These tend to appear in the **right posterior lung**.
![[Pasted image 20231018174418.png]]
## Liver
This is a small abscess filled with many neutrophils, an localized example of liquefactive necrosis.
![[Pasted image 20231018174529.png]]
# Images of Tissue with Caseous Necrosis
## Lung
This is a hilar lymph node which has taken on a cheesy tan appearance, a result of the combination of coagulative and liquefactive necrosis **in the setting of granulomatous inflammation** (a subtype of chronic inflammation). A granuloma is a ball of macrophages and other inflammatory cells. In this case, the granuloma with central necrosis indicates **tuberculosis**.
![[Pasted image 20231018174844.png]]

This is a more extensive example with a confluence of granulomas. The tissue destruction is so extensive there is some cavitation (cystic spaces) formed as debris drains.
![[Pasted image 20231018175004.png]]

This microscopic image of lung tissue is characterized by acellular pink areas surrounded by the granuloma inflammation. The blueish/purple cells are macrophages.
![[Pasted image 20231018175125.png]]
# Images of Tissue with Gangrenous Necrosis
## Toes
Gangrenous necrosis will feature necrosis of many body tissues, generally caused by ischemia. This is a "dry" gangrene from **frostbite**.
![[Pasted image 20231018175318.png]]
## Lower limb
This necrosis also resulted from a loss of blood supply, but is a "wet" variant in which there is a present liquefactive component. This case is a symptom of **diabetes** which reduces vascularity and wound healing.
![[Pasted image 20231018175539.png]]
# Images of Tissue with Accumulations
## Liver
Here, excess fats have been stored (steatosis) as a result of reduced lipoprotein transport from **chronic alcoholism**.
![[Pasted image 20231018175737.png]]
## Hilar lymph node
This features accumulation of anthracotic pigment (anthracosis), a carbon pigment. This case is from a **chronic smoker**, but the pigment itself does not actually cause dysfunction.
## Lung
This alveolar tissue has collected brown **hemosiderin** from macrophages, a side effect of the breakdown of red blood cells (releasing heme).
![[Pasted image 20231018180107.png]]
## Spleen
The large pale cells contain accumulated storage from lack of an enzyme. This example is from **Gaucher's disease**.
![[Pasted image 20231019005117.png]]
## Liver
These red globular materials are **Mallory Bodies** damaged by chronic **alcoholism**.
![[Pasted image 20231019005520.png]]
# Images of Tissue with Calcification
## Stomach
The far left demonstrates an artery with calcification of its walls, as well as an irregular blue/purple deposit in the submucosa. Calcified specimens feel firm and gritty as well as basophilic in appearance.
