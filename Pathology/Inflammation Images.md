# Acute Inflammation
## Lungs and alveolar spaces
Vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, neutrophils, vascular stasis.

Bronchopneumonia. Neutrophil exudate seen more clearly here, resulting in productive cough.

![[Pasted image 20231101223336.png]]

Necrotizing Pneumonia. Extensive neutrophilic exudate seen here with necrotizing pattern in center.

Mucosal surface with Ulceration of Gastric Mucosa. Epithelial tissue has sloughed off, with vasodilation of surrounding ulcer.

Lung surface with Necrotizing Bronchopneumonia. White splotches are necrotizing pattern.

## Fibrin mesh
Vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, neutrophils, vascular stasis.

## Brain
Bacterial meningitis. Red vessels from vasodilation. Pus wedge on left.

## Gallbladder
Columnar epithelium. Neutrophil infiltration of mucosa/submucosa (dark spots).

# Chronic Inflammation
## Lung
Influenza A. Interstitial infiltrate from lymphocytes creates swelling in alveolar walls.

## Synovium Joint
Rheumatoid arthritis. Lymphoid aggregate in dark region.

# Granulomatous Inflammation
## Lung
Tuberculosis with [[Necrosis and Apoptosis Images#Lung|caseous necrosis]].

# Foreign Body Giant Cell Reactions
## Sutures
Dark streak center-right.

## Aspirated Vegetable
Upper left of center. Neutrophils also present.

# Healing and Granulation Tissue
## Abscess
Granulation tissue and abscess to the left. New vessels forming. Pus on right side.

![[Pasted image 20231101225350.png]]
## Granulation tissue
Capillaries, fibroblasts, variable amounts of inflammatory cells.

![[Pasted image 20231101225440.png]]
## Healing biopsy site
Top layer is re-epithelialized skin. Underneath is granulation tissue, small capillaries, and fibroblasts forming collagen.

![[Pasted image 20231101225538.png]]
## Silicone granulomas
Prominent fibrosis. Dark center is collagen.
