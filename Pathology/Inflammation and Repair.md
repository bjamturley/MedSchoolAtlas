# Physiology of Vascular Events
## Vasodilation
Results in increased blood flow. Triggered by **histamine** (from mast cells) and **nitric oxide** (from endothelium/macrophages).
## Vascular permeability
Vessel endothelium becomes leaky. Can either be **early leakage** from direct endothelial damage which **lasts 15-30 minutes** (from leukotrienes and histamines), or **delayed leakage** which **starts after 2 hours and lasts 12 hours** (from kinins and complement).
## Cellular events
- **Margination**: Leukocytes collect in blood vessel lumen near endothelial surface
- **Adhesion**: Leukocytes have sugar molecules on surface which interact with selectins on endothelial surface. Goes from selectin to selectin as it "rolls" along surface. Eventually integrins activated for firm adhesion
- **Diapedesis (Transmigration)**: Leukocytes move across endothelium. Enhanced by adhesion molecules in intercellular junctions (PE-CAM)
- **Chemotaxis**: Leukocytes move to site of injury in tissue via chemical gradient. Stimulated by cytokines
- **Recognition**: Leukocytes express receptors that recognize external stimuli. (TLRs, GPCRs, opsonin receptors, cytokine receptors)
- **Removal**: Phagocytosis
# Acute Inflammation
Immediate response to injury. Triggered by **infections** (bacterial, fungal, viral) or **necrosis** (trauma, ischemia).

## Systemic effects
**Fever**: From cytokines/PGD
**Hypotension**: From cytokines
**Thrombosis**: From Platelet Activating Factor
## Morphology
**Congestion**: Increased blood in vessels
**Edema**: Increased interstitial fluid
**Necrotizing inflammation**: Neutrophils destroy cells
**Serous inflammation (blistering)**: Accumulation of thin fluid from plasma
**Fibrinous inflammation**: Heavy leakage carries proteins and deposits fibrin. Appears red and granular grossly and as pink threads histologically
**Suppurative (pus/purulent) inflammation**: Characterized by presence of a mass of neutrophils mixed with cellular debris, edema fluid, and microbes (pus)
## Possible outcomes
- Resolution
- Healing through fibrosis: Collagen accumulation leads to scarring
- Progression to chronic inflammation

Complications include the possibility of **abscess** (fibrous capsule of pus - yum) which required drainage, or **ulcer** (superficial epithelial or mucosal surface defect) which is quite painful.
# Chronic Inflammation
The result of persistent infections, exposure to toxic substances, or [[hypersensitivity]] disorders.
## Cell mediators
### Macrophages
For more on macrophages in the innate immune system, see here: [[Innate Immunity and the Complement System#Macrophages]]

When activated, they undergo morphologic changes like increasing in size and increasing number of lysosomal enzymes.

**Classical activation (M1)** comes from **IFN-gamma** and **microbes**. These macrophages produce nitric oxide, radical oxygen species, and lysosomal enzymes for pathogen assassination, and interleukins and chemokines for additional response.

**Alternative activation (M2)** comes from **IL-4** and **IL-13**. These macrophages produce growth factors, activate fibroblasts and promote tissue repair through anti-inflammatory factors/fibrosis.
### Lymphocytes
Activated [[Innate Immunity and the Complement System#Lymphoid lineage|lymphocytes]] are larger and have a bigger, less basophilic nucleus.

Macrophages and lymphocytes are chatty and exchange information. Macrophages display antigens to T cells and also produce cytokines to recruit more leukocytes (**IL-1, IL-6, and TNF**). Conversely, lymphocytes will produce **IFN-gamma** which activates macrophages, as well as **IL-17** and **TNF** for leukocytic recruitment.
### Plasma cells
Developed from activated B-cells and produce antibodies. In chronic inflammation, plasma cells accumulate in tissue.
### Other involved cells
Eosinophils can contribute to tissue damage. Mast cells are involved in fibrosis.
## Granulomatous inflammation
Characterized by a collection of macrophages and other inflammatory cells that form a “ball-like structure” to wall off infections.
### Foreign body type
Caused by inert foreign bodies (like sutures or splinters). Multiple macrophages come together to form giant cells in an attempt to phagocytose the material. The material can usually be seen microscopically at the granuloma center under polarized light.
### Immune type
Caused by persistent infections from poorly degradable particles. The center of the granuloma is either *caseating* which have a central necrosis (e.g. **tuberculosis**), or *non-caseating* which do not (e.g. **syphilis, cat-scratch disease, sarcoidosis**).
## Systemic effects
- **Systemic inflammatory response syndrome**: Acute response from prolonged inflammation stemming from IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Includes fever, leukocytosis, and acute phase proteins.
- **Fever**: Elevation of body temperature by 1-4 deg C (IL-1 and TNF-alpha → cyclooxygenases → arachidonic acid → [[NSAIDs#Prostaglandins]] → hypothalamus). Typically associated with infection. Helps with controlling invaders. NSAIDs can be taken to relieve fever by blocking prostaglandin production.
- **Leukocytosis**: Increases white blood cell count and will be reflected on complete blood count (CBC) measure. 
- **Neutrophilia**: Increased number of neutrophils.
- **Lymphocytosis**: Increased number of lymphocytes.
## Acute phase
Liver begins producing cytokines. These serve as markers for chronic inflammatory disorders, autoimmune disorders, or relapse after therapy failure. Other symptoms include tachycardia, peripheral vasoconstriction, rigors, chills, anorexia (loss of appetite), and malaise (tiredness).

Common proteins include **C-reactive protein (CRP)**, **fibrinogen**, and **serum amyloid protein**. Higher protein count is reflected by **Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)** which measures the rate at which RBC descend in a standardized tube. Increased level of acute phase protein is associated with aggregation of RBCs, increasing ESR.
## Clinical peals
### Mononucleosis
From viral infection. Swollen lymph nodes, increased number of lymphocytes.
### Syphilis
From persistent *Treponema pallidum* (gram negative spirochete). Causes rashes on palms and sores. Forms a gumma (lesion). Central cells are necrotic with a cellular outline.
### Asbestos
Will see macrophages and scattered lymphocytes.
### Silicone
Will see granulomatous of macrophages and lymphocytes, which surround it.
### Arthritis
Autoimmune response results in a rheumatoid nodule and accumulates lymphocytes and plasma cells.
### Hepatitis C
Leads to aggregation of lymphocytes in portal triads and destroys surrounding tissue. Immune cells stimulate fibroblasts to secrete collagen to promote fibrosis. However, extensive fibrosis can lead to scarring of liver (cirrhosis).
### Bile duct destruction
Lymphocytes surround the duct and result in tissue destruction.
### Hashimoto's thyroiditis
Autoimmune response from [[hypersensitivity]] disease leads to parenchyma.
### Tuberculosis
Caused by *mycobacterium tuberculosis*. Forms a caseating granuloma.
### Leprosy
Caused by *mycobacterium leprae*. Forms non-caseating granulomas.
### Cat-scratch disease
From gram-negative bacillus. Forms rounded or stellate granuloma of central granular debris and recognizable neutrophils.
### Sarcoidosis
Forms non-caseating granulomas with lots of macrophages.
### Chron's disease (IBD)
Sometimes forms non-caseating granulomas in the intestines with dense chronic inflammatory infiltrate.
# Healing and Repair
**Regeneration** occurs in cells with superficial damage. Epithelial cells will regenerate from stem cells. **Scar formation** occurs in tissues with severe damage or compromised extracellular matrix (ECM) components. This will involve fibroblastic proliferation and collagen synthesis via **TGF-beta**.

**Growth factors** deliver signals to stimulate transcription of genes to regulates the cell cycle. They activate signaling pathways which stimulate DNA replication, promotes changes in metabolism which promote biosynthesis.

**Primary intention**: Uncomplicated, clean incisions, and minimal scar formation.
**Secondary intention**: Larger wounds, intensive inflammatory response, wound contracture.
## Steps
### 1. Inflammation
### 2. Proliferation
Angiogenesis gives rise to new blood vessels by budding off from pre-existing vessels. Critical for formation of granulation tissue, which appears edematous (loose). Fibroblasts are stimulated to secrete collagen and other ECM components.

Ongoing inflammation and stimulation of fibroblasts leads to **fibrosis**, or the abnormal deposition of collagen that occurs in internal organs with chronic disease.
### 3. Scar formation
### 4. Tissue remodeling
Balance of deposition/degradation of ECM and collagen. **Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)** act to degrade collagen. 

**Wound contraction** occurs with periphery myofibroblasts network contraction and production of collagen in large surface wounds.
## Common complications
Wound healing can be impacted by poor nutrition/metabolism, blood supply, anti-inflammatory hormones, infection, mechanical stimulation, foreign bodies, size, and location.

- **Hypertrophic scar and keloid**: Accumulation of excessive amounts of collagen during the repair
process that becomes raised and/or extend beyond the boundaries of the original wound
- **Wound dehiscence**: Rupture of the wound that occurs most commonly after abdominal surgery, often due to increased pressure or mechanical stress on the wound.
- **Ulceration**: Superficial epithelial layer sloughs off; often occur secondary to inadequate vascularization.
- **Contractures**: Can be a normal part of healing but if becomes excessive, results in deformity that leads to a functional deficit.
