# Psoriasis
Chronic, inflammatory disease of skin and/or joints that causes rapid turnover of skin cells. Will see periods of intense flares in which there is pain, itch, or persistent warmth and swelling around a joint.
## Clinical features
**Plaque**: Red plaques with thick white/silver scales. Favors extensor elbows, knees, scalp, lower back
**Guttate**: Small lesions favoring the trunk and upper extremities. Typically in children, young adults
**Erythrodermic**: Fully body redness/erythema
**Pustular**: Focal/diffuse sterile pustules on erythematous base
**Nail changes** : Defective keratinization of proximal nail fold (forming pits), or discoloration and oily material in nail bed
## Pathogenesis
Environmental triggers activate keratinocytes, which stimulate inflammatory messengers.

*Key cell types*
- Dendritic cells 
- Mast cells 
- TNF-alpha proteins 
- IL-17, IL-12/23
## Histology
- Epidermal thickening (acanthosis)
- Parakeratosis (nuclei retained in [[Integument#Stratum Corneum|stratum corneum]])
- Loss of granular cell layer
- Dilated capillaries
- Neutrophil recruitment
## Treatment
- Topical creams: Salicylic acid to shed the outer layer of skin, as well as moisturizers
- Vitamin D derivates and coal tar to slow skin growth
- Light therapy (narrow band UVB)
- Injectables which mimic natural body function and inhibit immune cytokine pathways implicated in disease development (TNF-alpha, IL-12/23, IL-17, etc.)
### Corticosteroids
**The most common treatment**. Has classes of strength, 1 being the strongest and 7 being the weakest. Long term use can lead to atrophy, neovascularization, and steroid acne. Can also suppress natural hormone production.

**High potency**: Clobetasol
**Medium potency**: Triamcinolone
**Lowest potency**: Hydrocortisone
# Atopic Dermatitis
Chronic pruritic inflammatory skin disease with a wide range of severity. Periods of remission and exacerbation.

A type of eczematous dermatitis, but not synonymous with eczema.
## Clinical features
Tends to **spare areas around nose** due to being sebum-rich. Erythematous papules can form erythematous plaques that may display weeding, [[Dermatology Exam#Crust|crusting]] or [[Dermatology Exam#Scale|scaling]].

Distribution varies by age
- Infants: Cheeks, forehead, scalp, extensor surfaces
- Adolescents: Flexural areas
- Adults: [[Dermatology Exam#Lichenification|Lichenification]] in flexural regions, extremities and face
## Pathogenesis
Part of the **atopic triad**: Asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis.
## Treatment
Long-term use of **emollients and topical steroids** for acute flares. Antihistamines for pruritis and sleep issues.
# Acne
## Clinical features
Usually in areas with abundant sebaceous glands, beginning with clogged pores (comedones).
## Pathogenesis
Increased sebum production and keratin, sebum plug the pore. Finally, *[[Clostridia and Other Anaerobes#Cutibacterium acnes|Cutibacterium acnes]]* proliferates in the sebaceous follicle and stimulates pro-inflammatory cytokines.
## Morphology
**Open comedones**: Blackheads
**Closed comedones**: Whiteheads

**Nodulocystic** acne will lead to scarring.
## Treatment
Often fails due to lack of adherence, as results generally take 2-3 months.

**Mild**: Topical retinoid or benzoyl peroxide
**Moderate** (inflamed lesions): Topical retinoid and benzoyl peroxide, plus potentially a topical antibiotic
**Severe** (extensive inflamed lesions and scarring): Oral antibiotics, topical retinoid and benzoyl peroxide

Hormonal therapy (in females) or isotretinoin may be considered if the response is inadequate.
### Topical
- **Retinoids (Vitamin A derivatives)**: Normalize desquamation of follicular epithelium and prevents new comedone formation. Can cause dryness, redness, or photosensitivity.
- **Benzoyl peroxide**: Has antibacterial and comedolytic properties and generates free radicals that oxidize *C. acnes* cell wall
### Oral
- **Antibiotics**: Reduce *C. acnes* colonization of skin/follicles. Usually **[[Antibiotics#Doxycycline|doxycycline]]**.
- **Spironolactone**: Affects androgen receptors in sebaceous glands for decreased sebum production. Can block testosterone effects, so **only used in cis-women women and trans-women**.
- **Isotretinoin** (Accutane): Retinoic acid derivative that targets all four pathophysiologic factors involved in acne. Only used in severe cases and is **teratogenous** (to the extent that women have to pledge to be using two forms of contraception if prescribed).
# Drug Rashes
## Clinical features
Immediate reactions occur less than an hour after consumption. Urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis are common co-occurrences.

Delayed reactions can occur weeks or months after consumption.
### Exanthematous eruptions
[[Hypersensitivity#Type IV Hypersensitivity|Type IV hypersensitivity reaction]] occurring 7-10 days after consumption. Often caused by antibiotics or anticonvulsants. Fully resolves a within a week after stopping the medication.

Erythematous macules and mild lesions initially appear on trunk then spread centrifugally to the extremities. May also see pruritus and mild fever.
### Systematic reactions
**Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS)** or **Toxic Epidermal Necroylsis (TEN)**. Dermatologic emergencies that involve extensive necrosis and detachment of the epidermis and mucosal surfaces. They differ in severity based on extent of body surface area covered.

Typically begins within 8 weeks after starting drug. Begins with erythematous, irregularly shaped,  red to purpuric macules that coalesce. Lesions evolve to flaccid blisters, which spread and break easily (positive [[Dermatology Exam#Erosion|Nikolsky sign]]).

Can have permanent sequelae, such as blindness.

# Pemphigus Vulgaris
## Clinical Features
Flaccid [[Dermatology Exam#Bulla|bullae]] and erosions and positive [[Dermatology Exam#Erosion|Nikolsky sign]]. Involvement of mucus membranes. Older age of onset (50+ years old).
## Pathogenesis
IgG antibodies against cell surface of keratinocytes in a net-like distribution.

*Biopsy findings*
- **Intraepidermal blister above the basal layer**
- **Tombstoning**
- **Acantholysis** (keratinocytes falling apart)
## Treatment
High dose systemic glucocorticoids and then transitioning to biologic attacking pathogenic B cells.
# Bullous Pemphigoid
## Clinical features
Tense, pruritic [[Dermatology Exam#Bulla|bullae]] and urticarial lesions (erythematous, inflamed plaques). Negative [[Dermatology Exam#Erosion|Nikolsky sign]]. Older age of onset (60+ years old).
## Pathogenesis
IgG antibodies against hemidesmosomes.

*Biopsy findings*
- Band-like/linear deposition of IgG and C3 at the dermo/epidermal junction
- Subepidermal blister with eosinophilic fluid
## Treatment
Systemic or topical glucocorticoids depending on extent of disease and transition to “steroid sparing agent” for more severe cases.
