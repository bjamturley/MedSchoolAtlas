# Fatty acid structure
Have a carboxyl group on the alpha end of a hydrocarbon tail. The omega carbon is the final carbon on a tail.

When the tail has double bonds (unsaturation = removing electrons), add a Δ at the position of the double bond. For example: 16:1(Δ5) is a fatty acid with 16 carbons and one double bond at position 5.

Naturally occurring fatty acids have *cis* double bonds. These won't pack as tightly as *trans* fatty acids which have a higher melting point. Trans-fats, like olive oil, are therefore liquid at room temp.

# Lipid classes

Lipids can be divided into two classes: **Fatty acids** and **isoprenes**. The two types of membrane lipids are **glycerophospholipids** and **sphingolipids**
## Triacylglycerols
Only lipid used for energy storage. Contains 3 fatty acids (ester bonds). No polar head groups makes it poorly soluble. Is transported in lipoprotein complexes.

## Glycerophospholipids
Derived from *phosphatidic acid* (glycerol + 2 fatty acids and phosphate). Has a **phosphatidyl-insert head group**.

## Plasmalogens
These are precursors to signaling molecules (e.g. platelet activating factor). Similar structure to phospholipids, but has an **ether** linkage.

## Sphingolipids
These are important for sugar coating (glycocalyx) mammalian cells. Also a key player in blood groups. Defects can cause lysosomal storage diseases. Has a sphingosine backbone, a fatty acid tail, and a polar head group.

**Ceramide**: Simplest sphingolipid. Hydrogen head group.

## Sterols
Has 4 rings and a polar head group.

**Notable alumni:**
- Cholesterol
- Fat soluble vitamins E/A/K
- Ubiquinone (electron carrier)
# Membrane notes
Membranes contain lipid rafts. These are high in cholesterol (non-fluid) and often have GPI anchored membrane proteins.

**Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors**: Allow proteins to attach to the outer leaflet

**Peripheral proteins**: Can be washed away with salt
**Integral proteins**: Require a detergent/treatment to be removed. These can be on one side of the bilayer or span both. For integral proteins which span, the portion inside is made of alpha helices/beta barrels which can form pores.
	- **Alpha helices**: Hydrophobic amino acids
	- **Beta barrels**: Hydrophobic amino acids closer to tails (outside of barrel) while hydrophilic amino acids are in the inside of the barrel
