# Sanger Sequencing
The DNA in question will be decomposed into pieces of random length with the ends capped with radiolabeled ddNTPs. Therefore, the final nucleotide is known for all these pieces. The strands can then be assembled by length (or weight) by using a gel, which allows the order of nucleotides to be found.

Gels are read bottom up. Remember the actual sequence is the complement of it.

Frankly, this is an outdated method and has limited practical utility. Its a reflection on the curriculum that we're still taught it. Next generation sequencing is massively parallel and much more precise.
# Therapies
## Somatic cell therapy
Non-reproductive cells are altered to correct a gene deficit. These corrections are not passed to offspring.

Retroviral vectors help make this therapy more efficient, but may produce harmful/immunogenic products. In addition, integration into the genome is random which could break existing genes
