# Comparing Fuel Sources
## Fatty acids/triacylglycerols
**Pros**: High storage density and easy mobilization
**Cons**: Metabolism requires a lot of oxygen, is slower to generate ATP, and produces reactive oxygen species (ROS)
## Ketone Bodies
**Pros**: Provide brain food under low glucose conditions, will pass through the blood brain barrier faster than fatty acids
**Cons**: Can create acidic conditions in the blood
## Amino Acids/Proteins
**Pros**: Can be converted to glucose and TCA intermediates
**Cons**: Use requires destruction of useful molecules
## Glucose/Carbohydrates
**Pros**: Can be used aerobically and anaerobically
**Cons**: Exerts osmotic pressure limiting storage capacity.

The hydroxyl groups on glucose will react with other macromolecules like proteins, creasing osmotic pressure in the cells. **Storing glucose as glycogen reduces the osmotic pressure**.

# Glycogenesis
Glucose-1-phospate (G1P) is first added to UDP via **UDP-glucose phosphorylase**, forming UDP-glucose. This bond energy can then be used **glycogenin** to make short primer chains of 8 glucose molecules attached to a tyrosine.

These short chains are then added to a growing glycogen chain with 1,4 bonds catalyzed by **glycogen synthase**. Glycogen branching enzyme will form the 1,6 linkages from 1,4 linkages, which is endothermic.
## Regulation
Glycogen synthase is **active when dephosphorylated** and is inactivated by phosphorylation via **protein kinase A**, **phosphorylase kinase**, and **GSK-3**. **Phosphoprotein phosphatase 1 (PP1)** can dephosphorylate glycogen synthase, activating it.

**Insulin** will **prevent the glycogen synthase from being inactivated**, whereas **glucagon** and **epinephrine** **inactivate glycogen synthase** (and inhibit PP1).

Insulin promotes glycogen synthesis.
Glucagon/epinephrine turn off glycogen synthesis.
# Glycogenolysis
Breakdown is mediated by **glycogen phosphorylase** which can hydrolyze glucose within **4 residues** of its branch point. **Debranching enzyme** both will move 1,4 linked sugars near a branch point closer to another non-reducing end for glycogen phosphate and also hydrolyze the remaining 1,6 branch point, popping off the free glucose-1-phospate (G1P). Real trooper this one.

Turning 1,6 bond into a 1,4 bond is **endothermic** (requires energy). Breaking a 1,6 linkage is **exothermic** (releases energy).

Debranching is the **rate-limiting step of glycogen breakdown**.
## Products
### Skeletal muscle 
G1P is converted directly into glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) via **phosphoglucomutase** for use in [[Glycolysis and Pentose Phosphate#Glycolysis steps|glycolysis]].

**Hexokinase I** is present in skeletal muscle (not the liver). It will convert free glucose to G6P even at low glucose levels to keep it in the muscle for use.
### Liver/Pancreas
Glucose is converted to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) through a few intermediate steps. It is then converted to free glucose in the ER via **glucose-6-phosphatase** which allows it to diffuse into the blood.

**Glucokinase** (hexokinase IV) is present in the liver (not skeletal muscle). It will convert free glucose to G6P when glucose is abundant so as to only allow glucose to diffuse out of the cell when blood concentration is low.
## Regulation
Glycogen phosphorylase is activated by **phosphorylase kinase**, which is activated by glucagon, catecholamines, Ca2+, and protein kinase A. Phosphorylase kinase is inactivated by **phosphoprotein phosphatase 1 (PP1)**, turning off glycogen breakdown.
# Clinical Pearls
## Glycogen Storage Disease Type I (Von Gierke's Disease)
A deficiency in Glucose 6-phosphatase causes glycemia as G6P cannot enter the blood.
## Andersen's Disease
A deficiency in branching enzyme causes rapid glycogen depletion, diminished hyperglycemic response to epinephrine (less non-reducing ends on glycogen), and cirrhosis of the liver.
## McArdle's Disease
A deficiency in muscle glycogen phosphorylase impairs glycogen breakdown. This will reduce the blood lactate and pyruvate after exercise as there is no anaerobic glycolysis in muscle. pH, therefore, will be unchanged with exercise.
