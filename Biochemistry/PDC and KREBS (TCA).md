# Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (PDC)
The PDC turns pyruvate into acetyl-CoA (generated from [[Glycolysis and Pentose Phosphate|Glycolysis]]), NADH, and CO2. It is built from three different enzymes (E1, E2, and E3). This first step in this process is **irreversible**.

**Enzymes**
- ***E1***: Pyruvate dehydrogenase
- ***E2***: Dihydrolipoyl transacetylase
- ***E3***: Dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase

**Cofactors for the PDC**
- **Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)**, derived from thiamine
- **Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD)**, derived from riboflavin
- **Coenzyme A (CoA)**, derived from pathothenic acid
- **NAD+**, derived from niacin
- **Lipoic acid** (produced by humans)
## Steps
![[Pasted image 20230821133723.png]]
### 1: Pyruvate releases CO2 (decarboxylation) via ***E1***
High energy and irreversible, this step drives the remaining 4 steps forward. The decarboxylation produces a negative charge which reduces the remaining 2-carbon molecule from ketone to alcohol.

*Note: When gas is released, it diffuses out of the tissue and increases the entropy of the forward reaction. Thus, reactions which release gas tend to be more forward-favorable.*
### 2: Alcohol on the hydroxyethyl reduces lipoic acid's disulfide bond via ***E1***
### 3: Acetyl is transferred to CoA, forming acetyl-CoA via ***E2***
**OUTPUT**: Acetyl-CoA is passed to the ETC.
### 4: Lipoic acid reduces FAD to FADH2 via ***E3***
### 5: FADH2 transfers electrons to NAD+, forming NADH via ***E3***
**OUTPUT**: NADH is passed to the ETC, resulting in 2.5 ATP.
## Regulation of the PDC
High concentrations of NADH and acetyl-CoA will **drive the last four reactions backwards**. Additionally, **pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)** is activated by NADH/acetyl-CoA. PDK will phosphorylate ***E1***, inactivating it.
## Clinical Pearls for the PDC
All of the following disorders have decreased PDC activity. Neural symptoms will result from the inefficient conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. For these cases, there will be a buildup for pyruvate in the mitochondria/cytosol and will lead to more lactate. However, the total ratio of pyruvate to lactate will remain the same.
### Wernicke Encephalopathy 
Associated with chronic alcohol abuse.

**Symptoms**:
- Ocular abnormalities
- Ataxia
- General confusion
### Beriberi
Results from deficiency in Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP).

**Symptoms**:
- Fatigue
- Irritability
- Sleep disturbance
- Abdominal pain
- Anorexia
### Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex Deficiency
Manifests in infancy or later childhood. Patient will have a high blood lactate and normal pyruvate/lactate ratio.

**Symptoms**:
- Intermittent ataxia
- Poor muscle tone
- Abnormal eye movements
- Seizure
# Krebs (TCA) cycle
This will take the acetyl-CoA from the PDC and make energy with it. The rate acetyl-CoA can be used **depends on the availability of TCA intermediates** (e.g., oxaloacetate).

**Carbons**: 66544444
*Six, six, five, and five fours*
## Steps
### 1 .  Citrate (6C)
Formed from acetyl-CoA (2C) and oxaloacetate (4C). This step is **irreversible**.
### 2. Isocitrate (6C)
The energy for this step (thioester hydrolysis) is provided by the previous reaction in 1.
### 3. Alpha-ketoglutarate (5C)
This is the first oxidation step, releasing CO2 gas containing the lost carbon. This is **irreversible**.
### 4. Succinyl-CoA (4C)
Highly similar to PDC, also releases CO2 gas. This step is regulated by product inhibition (build up of succinyl-CoA/NADH). This is **irreversible**.
### 5. Succinate (4C)
Although a thioester bond is hydrolyzed like the second step, its work is conserved in production of GTP.
### 6. Fumarate (4C)
This is [[Oxidative phosphorylation and the ETC#Complex II Succinate dehydrogenase|complex II of the ETC]] (reduction of FAD to FADH2). Formation of alkene double bond.
### 7. Malate (4C)
Hydration of alkene double bond.
### 8. Oxaloacetate (4C)
Oxidation step. Although the [[Fuel Metabolism Primer|free energy]] of this reaction is not favorable (dG = 29.7 kJ/mol), the small amount of OAA available is a strong driver of the reaction to the right under normal conditions.
## Final products:
- 3 NADH
- 1 FADH2
- 1 GTP
