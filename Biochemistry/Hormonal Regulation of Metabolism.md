# Insulin
Secreted from pancreatic beta islets. Responds to high glucose by transporting glucose into cells via **GLUT-4**. **GLUT-2** is insulin independent and is used in the liver/pancreas to evaluate the blood glucose level in order to maintain homeostasis. In the brain, where glucose is the primary form of energy, an insulin independent transporter is used to bring glucose into the cell (GLUT-1/3).

*Preproinsulin → proinsulin → insulin*

1. **Preproinsulin** = Peptide A + Peptide B + Peptide C + signal sequence
2. **Proinsulin** = Peptide A + Peptide B + Peptide C
3. **Insulin** = Peptide A + Peptide B

Because Peptide C is cleaved to form insulin, its concentration in the blood can be measured to evaluate the amount of insulin present. Diabetic patients administered insulin will not have Peptide C in their blood.
## Signal Transduction
The pancreas uses GLUT-2 transporters, meaning the glucose levels in the blood and pancreatic beta cells will be the same. As glucose enters the cell, they are trapped via conversion to G6P by [[Glycogen and Fuel Balance#Liver/Pancreas|glucokinase]], increasing the rate of ATP production. As ATP binds to ATP gated potassium channels, closing them, the membrane depolarizes and begins to gain Ca2+ via voltage gated calcium channels. The calcium will bind to insulin granules which release via exocytosis.

1. Glucose enters and is converted to G6P → energy production (ATP)
2. ATP concentration increases → Binds potassium channels
3. Potassium channels close → Depolarization
4. Depolarization → Ca2+ channels open
5. Ca2+ binds insulin granules → insulin release

As insulin is released, it binds to the insulin receptor (a [[Signal Transduction Primer#Receptor tyrosine kinases|Tyrosine Kinase Receptor]]). This will stimulate Protein Kinase B (PKA) which increases insertion of GLUT-4 in the cell membrane (more glucose uptake). It will also phosphorylate glycogen synthase kinase (inactivating it) so that glycogen synthase remains in its inactive, phosphorylated state.
# Glucagon
Secreted from pancreatic alpha islets. Responds to low glucose breaking down glycogen in the liver by lowering Fructose-2,6-Bisphosphate (F26BP) concentrations, an upregulator of [[Glycolysis and Pentose Phosphate#Regulators of PFK-1|PFK-1]] in the glycolysis.

It will also inhibit glycogen synthesis by phosphorylating [[Glycogen and Fuel Balance#Regulation|glycogen synthase]] as well as inhibit fatty acid synthesis by inhibiting [[Fatty Acid and Ketone Metabolism#Part 1. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase|acetyl-CoA carboxylase]] via cAMP to protein kinase A (PKA). PKA has the secondary function of activating [[Delivery of Fuel to the Mitochondria#Adipose tissue|lipase]] in adipocytes to break down TAGs.

# Catecholamines (Norepinephrine/Epinephrine)
These function similarly to glucagon and will also stimulate glucagon secretion and inhibit insulin. They will promote glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and fatty acid breakdown.

These hormones will also switch muscles to fatty acid usage for energy by blocking glucose uptake.
## Catecholamines and exercise
With exercise, these endorphins will inhibit insulin. In order to get glucose back into the cell to maintain energy, the **AMP-activated protein kinase (AMP-K)** pathway is activated through the energy expenditure (ATP → AMP). This will promote insertion of GLUT-4 transporters into the cell membrane which increase glucose uptake.

This is why exercise is important for diabetic patients as it helps lower blood glucose.
