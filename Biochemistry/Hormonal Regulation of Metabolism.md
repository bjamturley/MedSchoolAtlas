# Insulin
Secreted from pancreatic beta islets. Responds to high glucose by transporting glucose into cells via **GLUT-4**. 

**GLUT-2** is insulin independent and is used in the liver/pancreas to evaluate the blood glucose level in order to maintain homeostasis by secreting insulin or glucagon. In the brain, where glucose is the primary form of energy, an insulin independent transporter is used to bring glucose into the cell (GLUT-1/3).

*Preproinsulin → proinsulin → insulin*

1. **Preproinsulin** = Peptide A + Peptide B + Peptide C + signal sequence
2. **Proinsulin** = Peptide A + Peptide B + Peptide C
3. **Insulin** = Peptide A + Peptide B

Because Peptide C is cleaved to form insulin, its concentration in the blood can be measured to evaluate the amount of insulin present. Diabetic patients administered insulin will not have Peptide C in their blood.
## Signal Transduction
### Release
The pancreas uses GLUT-2 transporters, meaning the glucose levels in the blood and pancreatic beta cells will be the same. As glucose enters the cell, they are trapped via conversion to G6P by [[Glycogen and Fuel Balance#Liver/Pancreas|glucokinase]], increasing the rate of ATP production. As ATP binds to ATP gated potassium channels, closing them, the membrane depolarizes and begins to gain Ca2+ via voltage gated calcium channels. The calcium will bind to insulin granules which release via exocytosis.

1. Glucose enters and is converted to G6P → energy production (ATP)
2. ATP concentration increases → Binds potassium channels
3. Potassium channels close → Depolarization
4. Depolarization → Ca2+ channels open
5. Ca2+ binds insulin granules → insulin release
### Downstream effects
As insulin is released, it binds to the insulin receptor (a [[Signal Transduction Primer#Receptor tyrosine kinases|Tyrosine Kinase Receptor]]). This will stimulate **Protein Kinase B (PKB)** which increases insertion of GLUT-4 in the cell membrane (more glucose uptake). It will also phosphorylate glycogen synthase kinase (inactivating it) so that glycogen synthase remains in its inactive, phosphorylated state.

The glucose can then be converted to [[Fatty Acid and Ketone Metabolism#Triacylglycerols (TAGs)|glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P)]] from DHAP (glycolysis) for TAG formation.
# Glucagon
Secreted from pancreatic alpha islets. Responds to low glucose breaking down glycogen in the liver by lowering Fructose-2,6-Bisphosphate (F26BP) concentrations, an upregulator of [[Glycolysis and Pentose Phosphate#Regulators of PFK-1|PFK-1]] in the glycolysis.

It will also inhibit glycogen synthesis by phosphorylating [[Glycogen and Fuel Balance#Regulation|glycogen synthase]] as well as inhibit fatty acid synthesis by inhibiting [[Fatty Acid and Ketone Metabolism#Part 1. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase|acetyl-CoA carboxylase]] via cAMP activation of protein kinase A (PKA). PKA has the secondary function of activating [[Fatty Acid and Ketone Metabolism#Adipose tissue|lipase]] in adipocytes to break down TAGs.
## Signal transduction
The glucagon receptor is a [[Signal Transduction Primer#G-Protein coupled receptors (or seven transmembrane receptors)|GPCR]] receptor.
1. Gs → cAMP
2. cAMP → PKA
3. PKA → inhibit acetyl-CoA carboxylase, activate lipase

# Catecholamines (Norepinephrine/Epinephrine)
These function similarly to glucagon and will also stimulate glucagon secretion and inhibit insulin. They will promote glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and fatty acid breakdown.

These hormones will also switch muscles to fatty acid usage for energy by blocking glucose uptake.
## Catecholamines and exercise
With exercise, these endorphins will inhibit insulin. In order to get glucose back into the cell to maintain energy, the **AMP-activated protein kinase (AMP-K)** pathway is activated through the energy expenditure (ATP → AMP). This will promote insertion of GLUT-4 transporters into the cell membrane which increase glucose uptake.

This is why exercise is important for diabetic patients as it helps lower blood glucose.
## Signal transduction
Catecholamines bind **beta adrenergic receptors**, which are [[Signal Transduction Primer#G-Protein coupled receptors (or seven transmembrane receptors)|GPCR]] receptors.
1. Gs → cAMP
2. cAMP→ PKA
3. PKA → inhibit acetyl-CoA carboxylase, activate lipase

They will also bind **alpha adrenergic receptors**, which are [[Signal Transduction Primer#G-Protein coupled receptors (or seven transmembrane receptors)|GPCR]] receptors.
1. Gq → PIP2
2. PIP2 → IP3 and DAG (via PLC) 
3. DAG → PKC (via Ca2+)

*PKC: C for calcium!*
# Leptin
Released by adipose tissue, which informs the body it is satiated. It will promote [[Fatty Acid and Ketone Metabolism#Fatty acid (beta) oxidation|beta-oxidation]] and downregulate [[Fatty Acid and Ketone Metabolism#Triacylglycerols (TAGs)|TAG]] synthesis. It will interact with the hypothalamus by promoting release of norepinephrine. It will also increase cellular insulin sensitivity as leptin and insulin share a signaling pathway.

Leptin will also activate **AMP kinase (AMPK)**. In the muscle, AMPK will increase uptake of fatty acids and glucose. In the liver, AMPK will slow down fatty acid synthesis.

**Adiponectin** is another peptide hormone released by adipose which upregulates AMPK
