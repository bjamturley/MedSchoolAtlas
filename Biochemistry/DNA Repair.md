# DNA Damage
## Nitrous acid
Exposure to a nitrous acid can accelerate spontaneous deamination of bases. They can result in the following:
- Cytosine → Uracil
- 6-methylcytosine (methylated cytosine) → Thymine
- Adenine → Hypoxanthine
- Guanine → Xanthine
## UV radiation
Will lead to the formation of free radicals, which can cause the double bonds in pyrimidines to link, forming a dimer. **Thymine bases are particularly susceptible to this**.
# Mutation Types
## Silent
Nucleotide mutation encoding for the same amino acid as the original sequences. Does not affect phenotype.
## Transition
Point mutation involving a purine to a purine or a pyrimidine to a pyrimidine
## Transversion
Point mutation involving a purine to a pyrimidine or a pyrimidine to a purine
## Depurination
Removal of a purine nitrogenous base through hydrolysis
## Methylation
Addition of a methyl group through exposure to an alkylating agent. This can be purposeful and beneficial.
# Cytosine is a mutation hotspot
Cytosine-guanine dinucleotides are often methylated. When 5-methylcytosine is deaminated, the resulting thymine will result in an adenine rather than a guanine being placed.

This issue can sometimes be resolved as some repair systems will preferentially replace a T with a C when encountering a G/T mismatch, but this isn't a robust solution.

C-G sequences are generally palindromes and can be recognized as a hotspot for mutations.
# Base Excision Repair
Fixes small types of damage like **deamination** or **depurination**.

1. **DNA glycosylase**: Removes damaged base leaving a blank sugar moiety
2. **AP endonuclease**: Removes the sugar moiety
3. **DNA polymerase I**: Replaces the damaged base using the template strand
4. **DNA ligase: S**eals the strand closed (closes the "nick")

# Nucleotide Excision Repair
Fixes base mutations like **pyrimidine dimers**.

1. **UvrABC endonuclease**: Creates a "nick" on either side of mutation
2. **UvrD helicase**: Removes the improper stretch of DNA
3. **DNA polymerase I**: Replaces the missing DNA using template strand
4. **DNA ligase**: Seals the strand closed

# Clinical Pearls
## Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC)
Inability to introduce nicks and therefore properly repair mismatch mutations. Results from mutations in **hMLH1** or **hMSH2** genes.
## Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP)
Hypersensitivity to UV light and therefore predisposed to skin cancer. Results from a mutation in **Transcription Factor H**, which exhibits helicase activity. This makes it hard to fix thymine dimers with nucleotide excision repair.
## Cockayne's Syndrome & Trichothiodystrophy
Will present with abnormal growth and neurological symptoms. Also involves a Transcription Factor H mutation as in XP, however these mutations will affect Transcription-Coupled Repair rather than nucleotide excision repair.
