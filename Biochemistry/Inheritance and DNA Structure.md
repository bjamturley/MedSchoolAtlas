# Hardy-Weinberg
$p$ + $q$ = 1  
  
instance of:
p (dominant) + q (recessive) = 1 (total population)  

$p^2$ + $q^2$ + $2pq$ = 1  

instance of:
$p^2$ (homozygous dominant)  
$q^2$ (homozygous recessive)  
$2pq$ (heterozygous)  
equaling 1 (the total population)  
  
This is an expansion of the same principal. When the recessive gene is rare enough, you can estimate carrier frequency by making p = 1 (almost everyone homozygous for the dominant gene).

>**PROBLEM**
>A disease has an incidence of 1 in 40,000 in a population. What is the carrier frequency?
>
>**SOLUTION**
>$q^2$  =1/40,000
>$q$ = 1/200
>2pq = 2 x (1) x 1/200
>= 1/100 (of heterozygous individuals)
# Key concepts
**Central dogma**
1. DNA → RNA (transcription) via DNA-dependent RNA polymerases
2. RNA → Polypeptides (translation) via ribosomes
3. Polypeptides → magic (Jesuit values) via the Lord Almighty Jesus Christ
# Heredity
The **genome** is the heritable part of the the organism. Most genomes are DNA, although some viruses are RNA. **Epigenetics** is the process by which post-translational changes are passed on. **Chromosomes** are molecules of DNA. Eukaryotes keep chromosomes in their nuclei, although several organelles (e.g. mitochondria or chloroplasts) possess their own chromosomes. **Genes** are regions of a genome which are expressed as RNA or functional rRNA in ribosomes.
# Nucleotides
Built from a nitrogenous base, a sugar moiety, and one or more phosphates.

**Purine bases**: Adenine (A), guanine (G)
**Pyrimidine bases**: Cytosine (C), thymine (T), uracil (U)

A/G/C/T are found in DNA. In RNA, C is converted to U.
