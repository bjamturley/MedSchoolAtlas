# Oxaloacetate (OAA)
OAA is the rate limiting factor for the [[PDC and Krebs (TCA)|TCA (Krebs)]] cycle. Pyruvate can be converted to OAA via **pyruvate carboxylase**. [[Glycolysis and Pentose Phosphate|Glycolysis]] will generate this pyruvate. However, because glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm and TCA occurs in the cytosol, OAA must be transported.
# Shuttle systems
## Malate-Aspartate Shuttle
The Malate-Aspartate Shuttle will transport reducing agents (specifically NADH from [[Glycolysis and Pentose Phosphate|glycolysis]]) across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Organs which don't rely on aerobic glucose metabolism require this.
## Glycerol 3-Phosphate Shuttle
This is most common in the skeletal muscle and brain (high glucose utilizers). This is a fast way to regenerate NAD+ for GADPH in **aerobic** conditions (can't use the TCA cycle without oxygen). This shuttle is less efficient than Malate-Aspartate, but is faster.
## Carnitine Shuttle
This will transport fatty acids into the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. Using this system, fatty acids are converted into acyl-carnitine (1 ATP consumed). Use of ATP makes conversion to fatty acyl-CoA energetically expensive.

1. ATP is added to the fatty acid, creating a location for CoA-SH to bind to the chain.
2. ATP is kicked off, and fatty acyl-CoA will bind carnitine, catalyzed by **carnitine acyltransferase I (CAT I)**, which allows it to pass the membrane.

As carnitine-bound fatty acids cross the outer membrane, carnitine acyl transferase II (CAT II) will remove the carnitine. Fatty acyl-CoA can now be used for beta-oxidation in the mitosol.

The carnitine shuttle is regulated by **malonyl-CoA** which inhibits CAT I. Malonyl-CoA is an intermediate of fatty acid synthesis.
