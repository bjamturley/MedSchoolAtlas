Oxaloacetate (OAA) is the rate limiting factor for the [[PDC and Krebs (TCA)|TCA (Krebs)]] cycle. Pyruvate can be converted to OAA via **pyruvate carboxylase**. [[Glycolysis and Pentose Phosphate|Glycolysis]] will generate this pyruvate as well as important reducing agents (e.g. NADH). However, because glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm and TCA occurs in the cytosol, OAA/NADH must be transported.
## Malate-Aspartate Shuttle
The Malate-Aspartate Shuttle will transport NADH/oxaloacetate from [[Glycolysis and Pentose Phosphate|glycolysis]] across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Organs which don't rely on aerobic glucose metabolism require this.

**Malate transporter (to mitochondria):**
1. NADH transfers its electrons to oxaloacetate, converting it to malate (via **malate dehydrogenase**)
2. Malate is transported into the mitochondrial matrix through the malate-Î±-ketoglutarate antiporter
3. Malate is oxidized back to oxaloacetate, and NADH is regenerated

**Aspartate transporter (to cytoplasm):**
1. Oxaloacetate converted to aspartate (via **aspartate aminotransferase**). 
2. Aspartate is transported back to the cytoplasm and converted back to oxaloacetate
## Glycerol 3-Phosphate Shuttle
Converts cytoplasmic NADH to mitochondrial FADH2. This is most common in the skeletal muscle and brain (high glucose utilizers). This is a fast way to regenerate NAD+ for GADPH in **aerobic** conditions (can't use the TCA cycle without oxygen).

FADH2 has a lower ATP yield than NADH, making this shuttle less than Malate-Aspartate, but is faster.

1. NADH reduces dihydroxyacetone phosphate ([[Glycolysis and Pentose Phosphate#Glycolysis steps|DHAP]]) to G3P (via **G3P dehydrogenase**)
2. G3P is transported to the inner mitochondrial membrane 
3. G3P is oxidized back to DHAP (generating FADH2)
## Carnitine Shuttle
This will transport fatty acids into the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. Using this system, fatty acids are converted into acyl-carnitine (1 ATP consumed). Use of ATP makes conversion to fatty acyl-CoA energetically expensive.

1. ATP is added to the fatty acid, creating a location for CoA-SH to bind to the chain.
2. ATP is kicked off, and fatty acyl-CoA will bind carnitine, catalyzed by **carnitine acyltransferase I (CAT I)**, which allows it to pass the membrane.

As carnitine-bound fatty acids cross the outer membrane, carnitine acyl transferase II (CAT II) will remove the carnitine. Fatty acyl-CoA can now be used for beta-oxidation in the mitosol.

The carnitine shuttle is regulated by **malonyl-CoA** which inhibits CAT I. Malonyl-CoA is an intermediate of fatty acid synthesis.
