# Oxaloacetate (OAA)
OAA is the rate limiting factor for the [[PDC and KREBS!! (TCA)|TCA (KREBS!!)]] cycle. Pyruvate can be converted to OAA via pyruvate carboxylase. Glycolysis will generate this pyruvate. However, because glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm and TCA occurs in the cytosol, OAA must be transported.
# Shuttle systems
## Malate-Aspartate Shuttle
The Malate-Aspartate Shuttle will transport reducing agents (specifically NADH from glycolysis) across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Organs which don't rely on aerobic glucose metabolism require this.
## Glycerol 3-Phosphate Shuttle
This is most common in the skeletal muscle in brain (high glucose utilizers). This is a fast way to regenerate NAD+ for GADPH in **aerobic** conditions (can't use the TCA cycle without oxygen). This shuttle is less efficient than Malate-Aspartate, but is faster.
## Carnitine Shuttle
This will transport fatty acids into the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. Using this system, fatty acids are converted into acyl-carnitine (1 ATP consumed). Use of ATP makes conversion to fatty acyl-CoA energetically expensive.

1. ATP is added to the fatty acid, creating a location for CoA-SH to bind to the chain.
2. ATP is kicked off, and fatty acyl-CoA will bind carnitine, catalyzed by **carnitine acyltransferase I (CAT I)**, which allows it to pass the membrane.

As carnitine-bound fatty acids cross the outer membrane, carnitine acyl transferase II (CAT II) will remove the carnitine. Fatty acyl-CoA can now be used for beta-oxidation in the mitosol.

The carnitine shuttle is regulated by **malonyl-CoA** which inhibits CAT I. Malonyl-CoA is an intermediate of fatty acid synthesis.

# Triacylglycerol  (TAG)
How [[Primer - Lipids, Membranes, and Membrane Proteins|fatty acids]] are stored in the body. Only found in organs which perform gluconeogenesis (liver and kidneys). Starts with glycerol-3-phosphate, which can come from [[Glycolysis and Pentose Phosphate#Glycolysis steps|DHAP]] or by phosphorylating glycerol. Adipocytes rely on DHAP -> G3P as they do not perform gluconeogenesis.

TAG generation occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes and adipocytes, in which fatty acids are esterified onto glycerol with the expenditure of 1 ATP. This makes TAG an energetic investment which is made when energy is abundant. TAGs are always being made, even when starving, but the balance of catabolism and anabolism changes.

Palmitic acid (16C) is the primary fatty acid stored.
# Storage of fatty acids
## Intestines
Fatty acids are reformed into TAGs within intestinal cells. They are packed in **chylomicrons** with cholesterol and apolipoproteins. These are transported via the lymphatic system and dumped into blood circulation. Blood enzymes will break down the TAGs in chylomicrons, releasing the individual fatty acids. Individual fatty acids will cross straight through cell membranes.
## Liver
The liver has its own chylomicrons called VLDL. This contains apolipoproteins and TAGs produced from the liver's conversion of glucose to fatty acids. These liver chylomicrons will also enter the blood.
## Adipose tissue
Catecholamine receptors on adipose will signal cyclic AMP and Protein Kinase A (PKA). PKA phosphorylates **hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL)** and **perilipin**.

Perilipin is a protein which studs the outside of a fat droplet to encapsulate it. When phosphorylated, it allows HSL to free the TAGs in the droplet which will diffuse them into capillaries. Adipose fats will bind to albumin which provide an escort to cells.
