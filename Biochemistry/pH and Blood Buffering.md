# Introduction
**pH** is the number of H+ (proton) particles in solution.

$pH = log \frac{1}{[H+]}$
$pH = -log[H+]$

Therefore, as H+ increases in solution, pH decreases

Ka is the **acid dissociation constant**., or the likelihood to dissociate in solution. Stronger acids have a higher Ka.

Strong acids will dissociate completely which means for strong acids, the initial acid concentration and the final H+ will be equal,
# Henderson-Hassall Bach
## $pH = pKa + log \frac{[\text{conj. base}]}{[\text{acid}]}$

pKa is the point at which half the molecules are protonated  
pKa = -log(Ka)
# Buffers
Are a combination of strong acids and weak bases or strong bases and weak acids. These prevent large changes in pH.
