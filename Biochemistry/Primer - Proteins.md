# Protein basics
Amino acids are chiral in the L configuration. They are zwitterions (separate positive and negative groups) and are formed in a **condensation reaction** between an amine and carboxyl group.

**Primary structure**: Amino acids
**Secondary structure**: Local elements (alpha helices and beta sheets)
**Tertiary structure**: Structural units (folded) with a hydrophobic core
**Quaternary structure**: Multiple polypeptides (e.g. receptor complex)

**Hydrophobic forces** are the single strongest driving force in protein tertiary conformation.

**Alpha chains**: Polypeptide strands with left-handed helical conformation
**Alpha helices**: Right handed
# Collagen
Most common protein in mammals. Sequence has lots of Gly, Pro, and 4-hydroxyproline (modified pro). 3 alpha chains wrap around each other to form **tropocollagen**. This triple-helix is very strong which is why collagen is so strong, grouping together to form **fibrils**. Fibril cross linking relies on Lysine (Lys), 5-hydroxylysine (HyLys), and His residues and is dependent on **lysyl (Lysine) oxidase**.

Types:
- Tendon
- Skin
- Cartilage/bone
- Cornea

## Diseases
### Osteogenesis imperfecta
AKA brittle bone disease. Causes by defective type I collagen. A point mutation is sufficient to reduce collagen stability and produce an autosomal dominant disease.
### Ehlers-Danlos
A group of diseases which are characterized by hyper flexibility of joints and skin. Some types characterized by lysyl hydroxylase deficiency.
### Lathyrism (osteolathyrism)
Stems from ingestion of poisonous sweet pea seeds which inactivate lysyl oxidase. Leads to abnormalities in bones, joints, and large blood vessels.
### Scurvy
Blood vessel hemorrhage, tooth loss, poor wound healing, bone degeneration, and eventually heart failure. Stems from vitamin c deficiency required as a cofactor for prolyl (Proline) and lysyl hydroxylase.
# Post-translational modifications
Almost all polypeptides are processed to remove the amino terminal. **Met resides** will cleave the peptide bonds.
## Transport to ER
Proteins bound for the ER are tagged with a signal peptide.

1. Translation in cytoplasm
2. **Signal recognition particle (SRP)** bind the signal peptide / docks ribosome on ER membrane
3. Translation coupled with translocation into ER lumen
4. Signal peptide is cleaved **co-translationally** (before release from ribosome) by signal peptidase
## Insulin
Pancreas synthesizes preproinsulin (immature insulin) which has a pre-peptide, polypeptide A, a pro-peptide, and polypeptide B.  Removal of pre/pro peptide yields insulin.

**Propeptide**: A part of the polypeptide which much be removed to get the mature form.
## Zymogens
Are inactive pro-enzymes which have auto-inhibitory pro-peptides. Usually have the suffix -ogen (e.g. fibrinogen becomes fibrin).
## Glycoproteins
### N-linked glycosylation
Important for protein folding in the [[Primer - Cells and Organelles#Endoplasmic reticulum|ER lumen]], recognized by the calnexin/calreticulin chaperone system. The sugar is attached to a polypeptide at an Asn residue. The glycan is added co-translationally. All N-linked glycans have a mannose-rich core.
### O-linked glycosylation
Sugar is attached via a Ser or Thr residue, which happens after the protein is fully folded and entered the golgi.
## Proteoglycans
Glycoproteins which have a lot of carbs. Core has at least one glycosaminoglycan. These form the basement membrane or extracellular matrix.
### Aggrecan
A main proteoglycan of cartilage which can form huge complexes. Has a core protein with its N-terminal rich in N-linked oligosaccharides, a central region rich in O-linked sulfate chains, and a C-terminal rich in chondroitin sulfate.

Its brushlike structure and numerous negative charges capture water which act as a shock absorber when compressed.
## Ubiquitylation
Ubiquitin is often added to proteins which need to be degraded by the 26S proteosome. Phosphorylation -> ubiquitylation -> degradation.

Enzymes involved in activation:
1. Ubiquitin activating enzyme E1
2. Ubiquitin activating enzyme E2
3. Ubiquitin ligase E3 (this picks the target)

# Histone code
Modifications help determine which parts of DNA will undergo transcription.
