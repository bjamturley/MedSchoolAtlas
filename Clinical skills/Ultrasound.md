In which a machine yells into your body (quietly) and makes a picture based on many sound waves bounce back. Soft tissues will have a weaker echo and thus the machine ear (transducer) can discriminate anatomical features.

It's worth reviewing the spatial anatomical terms before conducting an ultrasound: [[Anatomy Nomenclature]]
# Artifacts
An image from faulty wave interpretation.
## Reverberation
Waves bounce between two hard surfaces. Requires an angle change, more gel, or patient repositioning. Seen below as the white line with reverberation underneath.

## Mirror image
Double the image, double the fun. The real one is usually closer to the transducer. Requires a change in probe angle.

## Twinkle
Waves will sometimes reflect of a calcified object and cause it to vibrate. In color flow mode ultrasounds, this can cause coloration outside the real tissue.

## Posterior shadow
Energy loss distal to a very hard object, causing occlusion. Requires moving the transducer around.

## Posterior enhancement
Opposite of posterior shadowing, in which there is brightness under a low density (anechoic) object like fluid.

## Ring down
Spaces with bubbles reverberate the liquid and create a vertical artifact.

## Edge
Shadow from a rounded structure. Requires scanning at a different angle.

## Noise
Grain. Requires decreasing the gain (amplification) or adjusting the Time gain Compensation (TCG).
# Probes
**Linear (12L)**: Vascular exams like carotid doppler
**Curvilinear (4c)**: Wide view angle for abdominal visualization or obstetrics
**Phased array (3S)**: Cardiac visualization (e.g., echocardiogram)
**Endocavitary probes**: Body cavities
