# Clinical Laboratory
- **Hematology**: Examination of cellular elements of blood (peripheral smear); includes separately clotting factors
- **Clinical chemistry**: Measurement of >200 substances in serum and body fluids
- **Transfusion medicine/blood banking**: Blood donor screening/testing, blood components, compatibility testing
- **Microbiology/immunology**: Microbial identification, susceptibility testing, determinations of immunity (AKA the reason why we’re drowning in cytokines and bacteria right now)
- **Immunoassays**: Endocrine testing, toxicology, and therapeutic drug monitoring
- **Medical microscopy/urinalysis**: Examination of body fluids (using micro-/macroscopic and physiochemical methods)
# Analytical Variables
- **Pre-analytical variables**: Patient preparation, specimen collection/handling
- **Analytical variables**: During/related to testing process (manual vs. automated); factors related to instrumentation (precision, accuracy)
- **Post-analytical**: Result reporting (calculations, transcription)
# Test Results and Values
- **Reference range**: a range of values/results considered to be “normal” for a certain type of quantity. This will tend to differ based on the stated description of a group of people that shares certain characteristics.
- **Panic/critical values**: threshold values beyond the expected range; can be life-threatening
- **Delta check**: a lab quality control measure that compares successive samples from the same patient
# Laboratory
Include separate tests that are related to the same organ system or are commonly ordered together.

- **Electrolyte panel**: tests for Na+, K+, Cl - , CO2 levels
- **Lipid panel**: cholesterol (HDL/LDL/other), triglycerides
- **Basic metabolic panel**: Na+, KCl, Cl - , CO2, creatinine, BUN, glucose, Ca2+
- **Hepatic function panel**: albumin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total protein
- **Obstetrical panel**: ABO and Rh blood typing, antibody screen, syphilis IgG, rubella Ab, CBC, HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen
## Hematology
Complete Blood Count (CBC)
- Hemoglobin
- Hematocrit
- White blood cell (WBC) count
- Platelet count
## Troponin
Troponin is a regulatory complex that modulates muscle contraction. **Troponin I is the most specific marker for acute myocardial infarction (MI)** and is considered the gold standard.

Detectable **within 4-6 hours** with a peak at 12-18 hours. Levels will return to baseline at 6 days, making **timing key in detection of acute MI**.
