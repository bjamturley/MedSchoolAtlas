# Cardio Exam: Step-by-step
1. Adjust table to a 45 deg angle (opening the foot rest) and stand to patient's right side

3. Drape patient so as to access the left side of their chest
4. Inspect precordium: Palpate 2nd, 3rd, and 4th intercostal spaces (right and left side of sternum)

5. Palpate PMI (Point of Maximal Impulse): 5th ICS/midclavicular
	- The patient may have to raise their left breast to access this
6. Auscultate heart with steth (**A**ll **P**hysicians **T**ake **M**oney). Use Diaphragm to hear S1 ("lub") and S2 ("dub") sounds.
	1. Aortic: 2nd ICS/right sternal border
	2. Pulmonic: 2nd ICS/left sternal border
	3. Tricuspid: 5th ICS/midclavicular line
	4. Mitral: 5th ICS/midclavicular line

7. Repeat with bell
	1. Tricuspid: 5th ICS/midclavicular line
	2. Mitral: 5th ICS/midclavicular line
8. Palpate carotid arteries: Bilaterally, one at a time (lol)
9. Auscultate carotid arteries (diaphragm)
	1. Have patient to hold breath when listening
11. Listen at medial border of SCM (diaphragm)
	1.  Ask patient to hold breath
12. Check jugular venous pressure
	1. Identify
	2. Locate top of jugular pulsations (meniscus)
	3. Place vertical ruler at sternum
	4. Place straight edge at top of jugular, intersecting with ruler perpendicularly
	6. Calculate JVP
		1. Measure vertical height on ruler and add 5cm
		2. 6-8 cm H2O is normal

13. Check bilateral radial pulses in wrists
14. Check bilateral dorsalis pedis (top of foot) pulses
15. Check for swelling. Firm pressure with thumbs looking for indentation in 3 areas (bilaterally):
	1. Dorsum of foot
	2. Lower tibia
	3. Upper tibia
# Pulm Exam: Step-by-step
1. Ask patient to expose back
2. Inspect shape of chest rise
	1. Observe breathing rate, effort, and muscle use
3. Respiratory expansion (normal rate = 12-16 BPM)
	1. Place hands on mid back, around lower rib 10
	2. Ask patient to take deep breath
	3. Assess chest excursion, checking for symmetry
4. Percuss posterior lung fields (horizontal and then vertical, to compare sides)
	1. Place hand on back, tapping firmly on middle finger
	2. 5 posterior and 2 lateral levels. Bilaterally and symmetrically, avoiding scapula

5. Percuss anterior lung fields: 2 levels
	1. 1 above clavicle and 1 below clavicle (**we only do 1 and 2 for PETA**)

6. Auscultate lungs
	1. Ask patient to take deep breaths though open mouth
	2. 5 posterior and 2 lateral levels (same as above)
	3. 1 above clavicle and 1 below clavicle (same as above)

Notes on steth
**Diaphragm**: Good for all frequencies
**Bell**: Good for medium and low frequencies
