An extensive history is important for this exam.

First, identify the **primary lesion**, noting what we can see. Next, look at the **distribution** or which part of the skin is primarily affected (e.g. epidermal changes, vascular, dermal process, subcutaneous mass).

**Primary**: Macule, papule, nodule, vesicle, pustule, wheal
**Secondary** (changes with the primary): Scale, crust, excoriation, ulcer, atrophy, scar

**Flat**: Macule, telangiectasia, purpura
**Elevated**: Papule, plaque, nodule, wheal
**Depressed**: Atrophy, erosion, ulcer, scar

**Macula** have a diameter < 1 cm while **patches** have a diameter > 1 cm. If it is raised, it is not a macule or a patch. **Papule** are raised lesions < 1 cm while plaques are flat-topped lesions > 1 cm.
# Lichenification
The epidermis thickens and causes accentuation of natural skin lines. Caused by prolonged scratching or rubbing of the skin. Can be covered by scales which can be made transparent with alcohol.

# Lumps and Bumps
**Nodules** have a diameter > 1 cm. Palpable, solid and dome shaped. Usually found in the dermal of subcutaneous tissue.

**Tumors** have a diameter > 2 cm and are also solid growths.

# Urticaria
Hive or wheal. A special type of raised lesion which is a transient (< 24 hours), edematous papule or plaque caused by edema of the dermis. **Dermographism** is "skin writing" which causes the raised areas with gentle pressure or scratching.

# Blisters
## Vesicle
Small blisters (< 1 cm) filled with fluid (clear, serous, or hemorrhagic).

![[Pasted image 20231031173145.png]]
## Bulla
Large blisters (> 1 cm) filled with fluid (clear, serous, or hemorrhagic).

![[Pasted image 20231031172924.png]]
# Pustule
Small elevation of the skin containing pus. Follicular or non-follicular.

![[Pasted image 20231031173542.png]]
# Atrophy
**Epidermal atrophy**: Thinning of the epidermis, leading to wrinkles
**Dermal atrophy**: Loss of dermal collagen and/or elastin, leading to a depression

Can be distinguished from lichenification as the skin will not be thickened.

# Erosion
Partial loss of the epidermis (epithelium). Can occur after a vesicle or bulla forms and the top feels off, or because of scratching.

**Nikolsky sign**: Lateral pressure results in shearing

**Asboe-Hansen sign**: Intact blister spreads with pressure

![[Pasted image 20231031174423.png]]
# Ulcer
Full thickness loss of the epidermis and potential loss of dermis/subcutis.

![[Pasted image 20231031174544.png]]
# Cicatrix (scar)
Tissue which forms in a wound during healing. 

**Atrophic scars**: Depressed
**Hypertrophic scars**: Raised
**Keloid scars**: Extend beyond the boundaries of the original injury

# Scale
Accumulation of [[Integument#Stratum Corneum|stratum corneum]] from increased proliferation or delayed desquamation. White or yellow, rough.

![[Pasted image 20231031174843.png]]
# Crust
Dried sebum, pus, or blood mixed with epithelial or bacterial debris. Indicates infection or blistering.
