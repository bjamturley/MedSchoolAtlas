# Cellular Components
## Fibroblasts
Structural, produce fibers and ground substance.

## Adipose cells
### Unilocular adipocytes
**Function**: Fat cells, energy storage.
**Features**: Large fat cells which include one lipid droplet. Lots of open space with a thin cytoplasm along edge.

### Multilocular adipocytes
**Function**: Only present in neonates as a form of heat generation
**Features**: Include multiple lipid droplets and mitochondria

## Macrophages
**Function**: Phagocytic cells which take up debris
**Features**: Visible vesicles

## Plasma cells
**Function**: [[Lymphoid Tissue#Diffuse lymphoid tissue|Derived from B cells]], produce immunoglobulins. 
**Features**: Eccentric nucleus, cartwheel arrangement of heterochromatin, abundant RER.

## Mast cells
**Function**: Basophilic molecules containing pharmacologically active substances mediating allergy response. IgE on surface trigger an allergy response (**heparin, histamine, leukotrienes, proteoglycans, ECF-A**). 
**Features**: Large basophilic granules around a nucleus. Stains dark.

# Amorphous tissue
Known as **ground substance**. Molecules composed of varied protein and sugar ratios.
## Glycosaminoglycans
For more, see here: [[Carbohydrates and Sugar Code Primer#Glycosaminoglycans]]
Disaccharide sugars containing amino sugars. Hold water. An example is hyaluronic acid (in eye).
## Proteoglycans
A core protein connected to glycosaminoglycan chains. Brush like.

## Glycoproteins
For more, see here: [[Protein Primer#Glycoproteins]]

Globular proteins with branched sugar residues found in basement membrane. Binding sites for cells, collagen, and heparan. Examples include **fibronectin, laminin, and integrins**.
# Fibrous components
## Collagen fibers
For more, see here: [[Protein Primer#Collagen]]. Seen as thick fibers with **striations**.

**Functions**
- Adhesion
- Skeletal (bones, cartilage)
- Protective (skin)
- Messenger

**Synthesis**
1. Pre-procollagen translated from mRNA
2. Procollagen formed after cleavage of signal peptide
3. Hydroxylation/glycosylation (using **Vitamin C**)
4. Alignment of chains to form triple helix
5. Packaging into secretory vesicles, secretion
6. Formation of tropocollagen
7. Bundling to form fibril → fiber → fiber bundle
### Clinical pearls
**Scurvy**: Resulting from Vitamin C deficiency
**Ehlers-Danlos (VI)**: Faulty hydroxylation
**Ehlers-Danlos (VII)**: Decreased peptidase activity (step 6)
## Elastic fibers
Formed from oxytalan (fibrillin) and elastin. **Oxytalan** resists tension while **elastin** provides flexibility. Appears thin and brownish-red (stains with [[Histological Techniques, Epithelium, and Glands#Other stains|orecin]]). 
### Clinical pearl: Marfan Syndrome
Inherited mutation in fibrillin causing a weakened aorta, potentially leading to aortic dissection.
## Reticular fibers (type III collagen)
Found in lymphoid organs and tissues. Forms scaffolding allowing lymphocytes to take refuge as the mighty fluid current rushes past. Turns black with [[Histological Techniques, Epithelium, and Glands#Silver|silver stains]].
