A protective outer layer.

**Epidermis**: Outermost later
**Dermis**: Thicker, inside later
**Hypodermis**: Superficial [[Anatomy Nomenclature#Fascia|fascia]] laying underneath the dermis. Not actually part of the integument.
# Epidermis
It's your outer meat flesh. You know what this does.

**Thin epidermis**: Covers most of the body. Has a thin corneum layer without a lucidum.
**Thick epidermis**: Present in parts of body vulnerable to abrasion. Has a thick corneum and a lucidum.

## Layers
**C**ourtney **L**ove **G**ets **S**yphilis **B**iweekly
**C**orneum, **L**ucidum, **G**ranulosum, **S**pinosum, **B**asale
### Stratum Corneum
Contains non-living cells, makes the fingerprint
### Stratum Lucidum
Contains non-living cells, only in thick epidermis
### Stratum Granulosum
**Keratohyalin granules**: Bund filaggrin to keratin
**Lamellar granules**: Membrane coated, secrete lipid sheets to form intercellular cement (protect skin from desiccation)
### Stratum Spinosum
Keratinocytes connect to each other using cadherin proteins. [[Cells and Organelles Primer#Anchoring junctions|Desmosomes]] give a "spiny" appearance as an artifact of tissue shrinkage.
### Stratum Basale
Attached to basement membrane via hemidesmosome connections via [[Signal Transduction Primer#Adhesion receptor Integrins|integrin proteins]].
## Cell types
### Keratinocytes
Filled with keratin (intermediate) filaments, attached via desmosomes.

### Langerhan's cells
**Phagocytic** cells derived from monocytes with **immune functions**.
### Merkel's cells
Perform **sensory functions** and contain neurotransmitter filled granules. Located in basale.
### Melanocytes
**Produce melanin** via tyrosinase. Melanin granules travel to keratinocytes in spinosum and are arranged to be adjacent to the nucleus to protect DNA from sun damage. Found in basale.
# Dermis
## Papillary layer
Contacts the epidermis (basale) where it forms **peg and socket connections**, preventing it from shearing off. Contains capillaries and **Meissner's corpuscles (mechanoreceptors)**.

![[Pasted image 20230913185552.png]]
## Reticular layer
Dense connective tissue **responsible for wrinkles**. Contains fibroblasts, type I collagen, and elastic fibers. Also contains **Pacinian corpuscle** for deep touch/pressure sensitivity.

Also contains **arteriovenous (AV) shunts** responsible for thermal regulation. Will vasoconstrict in the cold and vasodilate in the heat.
# Nails
**Eponychium**: Cuticle/nail bed which the nail emerges from
**Hyponychium**: Skin underneath nail plate

# Hair follicles
## Shaft
The hair shaft is surrounded by the **internal root sheath** which stops at the sebaceous gland. The **external root sheath** extends into the epidermis and connects to an **erector pili muscle**, straightening the hairs when stimulated.
## Root
Contains the hair follicle as well as the bulb which houses the **germinal matrix** responsible for hair cell division. Also found here are melanocytes and papillary layer of dermis.
# Glands
For classification, see here: [[Histological Techniques, Epithelium, and Glands#Classification]]

![[Pasted image 20230913185516.png]]
## Sebaceous
Secretes onto hair shaft, simple branched acinar (holocrine secretion)

![[Pasted image 20230913185421.png]]
## Eccrine
Sweat gland, secretes to skin. Are Simple, coiled, and unbranched (merocrine secretion). Has a **secretory duct** in the dermis containing sweat as well as secretory granules/pheromones. Also secretes protein free filtrate. The **excretory duct** is stratified cuboidal epithelium and will grab Na and Cl salts before they're released.

## Apocrine
Sweat gland, secretes onto hair shaft. Simple, coiled, tubular. Note the secretion is MEROCRINE despite the name.
