**Freeze fracture**: Tissue is frozen and split into inner and outer leaflets. Can be used to see proteins embedded in the membrane.
## Preparation

**Preparation steps**:
1. Fix the tissue to stabilize it
2. Dehydrate
3. Embed it into a hardening material
4. Section into thin slices
5. Mount on slide and stain

# Epithelium
How to identify epithelium:
- Found on all body surfaces
- Covers all passage which connect to exterior
- Makes up secretory cells of glands
- No blood supply (avascular)
- Lies on basement membrane or basal lamina

Epithelium is either glandular or surface. It is classified by:
- **The number of cells**: Simple or stratified. Simple is when cells rest directly on basement membrane. Stratified is stacked layers.
- **The height/shape of the surface layer**: Squamous, cuboidal, or columnar. Squamous is flat (squat).

Other layer types:
- **Pseudostratified**: Not stratified, one layer but looks like several because nuclei are in different parts of the cell
- **Transitional**: Multiple variations in one tissue

*Note: if a cell is binucleated and stratified, it is BLADDER tissue*

| ------------------- | ------- | --------- |
| Simple squamous     |    ![[Pasted image 20230814160357.png]]     |      Endothelium, mesothelium, parietal layer of Bowman's capsule, thin segment of loop of Henle, rete testis, pulmonary alveoli     |

# Glands
## Definitions
**Glandular epithelia** are groups of cells which secrete things. Exocrine glands have an **acinus (secretory portion)** and a **duct (conducting portion)**.

- **Parenchyma**: secretory cells
- **Strome**: Connective tissue between parenchyma
- **Exocrine glands**: Surface or cavity secretions via ducts
- **Endocrine glands**: Blood stream secretion
## Classification
**1. Number of ducts**
	1. Simple (one)
	2. Compound (multiple)
**2. Shape of secretory portion**
	1. Tubular
	2. Branched tubular
	3. Acinar (grape shaped)
	4. Branched acinar
	5. Tubuloacinar
**3. Secretion type**
	1. Serous (aqueous)
	2. Mucous (mucinous glycoproteins)

**Modes of secretion**
1. **Merocrine** (most common): Vesicular release
2. **Apocrine**: When vesicles are so large, a portion of the cell is released (e.g. mammary glands)
3. **Holocrine**: Whole cell is shed (e.g. sebaceous glands)

## Cell surface specializations
### Microvilli
Filled with actin connected to terminal web, surrounded by glycocalyx containing glycosylated products

![[Pasted image 20230814165045.png]]
### Cilia
More brush like or fibrous than microvilli. Made of **9 + 2 microtubule axoneme structures**. Embedded in **basal bodies**, which are centrioles that nucleate axonemes of cilia

![[Pasted image 20230814165243.png]]
*An example of an axoneme*
### Stereocilia
Very thin microvilli found in male reproductive tract (epididymis) and vestibular apparatus of inner ear.
### Microplicae
Folds that can appear on the surface of cells, especially the GI
