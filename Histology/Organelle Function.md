# Cytoskeleton
Protein structures which provide structural integrity.
## Microtubules
Hollow, unbranched, and cylindrical. Are **polar** (+/- ends) with variable length. When organized into triplets, they are referred to as **basal bodies**.

**Functions**:
- Movement of flagella and cilia
- Cytokinesis
- Transport of organelles (kinesin moves towards +, dynein moves towards -)
- Buddies with the [[Cells and Organelles Primer#Golgi Complex (Apparatus)|Golgi]], holding it in place and acting as its transport network

**Location**: Neurons, platelets, leukocytes, any dividing cell
*Neurons have a lot of microtubules because they are constantly sending neurotransmitters*

## Actin filaments
Flexible, thin rods. Thin filaments are **actin**, thick filaments are **myosin**.

**Functions**:
- Resist cell shape change
- Muscle cell contraction (**sarcomere** has thick/thin filaments)
- Cell movement, cytokinesis, phagocytosis

**Location**: All cells

## Intermediate filaments (IF)
Wavy, unordered bundles of thin rods

**Functions**:
- Mechanical support/structural integrity
- Support desmosomes
- Link nucleus to plasma membrane
- Reinforce nuclear envelope

**Location**: Cells with a lot of mechanical stress

**Types**:
- **Nuclear lamins**: Critical for scaffolding the inner nuclear envelope and organizing DNA in interphase
- **Desmosomes**: Helps transmit forces between cells

### Clinical peal: Progeria (premature aging)
Causes by a mutation resulting in the production of Progerin instead of normal Lamin A which provides the nucleus structural integrity. As a result, we see "blebbed" nuclei which ages the body rapidly. Short life expectancy.

# Endocytosis and exocytosis
Process by which cells send and receive material
## Endocytosis
[[Cells and Organelles Primer#Transport out of ER]]
Stuff coming in the cell, via **invagination** of the cell membrane

**Types**:
- **Fluid-phase (pinocytosis)**: Non-selective, triggered by difference in gradient
- **Receptor-mediated**: Selective (e.g. by a hormone or growth factor). Uses clatherin coated vesicles
- **Caveolae**: Mediates transcytosis using **caveolin** coated vesicles
	- Intakes at one end of cell and exists at other end
	- For example, if a cell wants to push bacteria into the lymph
## Exocytosis
Transport out of the cell. Cells often branch off the golgi and then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the contents.

# Peroxisomes
Have a single thin membrane with a granular matrix on the inside. They uptake proteins from the cytoplasm to self-replicate.

**Functions**:
- Oxidation
- Respiration
- Fatty acid (long-chain) metabolism
- Regulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
- Bile acid metabolism

**Location**: Liver cells and kidney tubules, often near RER

## Clinical pearl: Zellweger syndrome (cerebrohepatorenal syndrome)
A mutation prevents peroxisomes from importing proteins across their membrane (unable to replicate). This causes brain, kidney, and liver abnormalities. Because **peroxisomes synthesize plasmalogens** (the predominant phospholipid in nervous tissue myelin) deficient myelination of neural cells.
# Inclusions
Subdomain of cellular content which is generally transient. Includes glycogen, lipid droplets, and pigment granules.

**Glycogen**: Found in muscle or liver cells near the endoplasmic reticulum (where glycogenolysis may occur). Is dark and forms clusters called rosettes in hepatocytes (liver).
**Lipid droplets**: Fat globs inside cells, appearing as white or light circles.

# Mitochondria
Typically scatter through cell but can concentrate if there is a lot of energy use. When there is **mitochondrial myopathy**, it typically **affects the muscles first**, since these cell types use a lot of energy, all the time.

*The only place you will not find mitochondria is mature erythrocytes.*
## Structure
- **Outer membrane**: **Porin** allows for passage of molecules
- **Intermembrane space**: Between outer membrane and inner membrane. ATP synthesis and apoptosis
- **Inner membrane**: Encloses the matrix with folds called **cristae** (increasing the surface area)
- **Matrix**: Has enzymes for TCA/Krebs/Citric acid cycle. Hosts mitochondrial DNA/ribosomes
## Clinical pearl: Wilson disease
Mitochondria will have dark, dilated cristae and a non-uniform look
# Centrioles
**Structure**: Made up of 9 microtubule triplets
**Function**: Helps transport Golgi vesicles to other parts of the cell
**Location**: Varies based on cell stage. Will migrate to poles during mitosis.
# Centrosome
Structure: Made up of a pair of centrioles
Function: Organizes microtubules and is the origin of new microtubules/the mitotic spindle
Location: Near the nucleus, associated with the Golgi
