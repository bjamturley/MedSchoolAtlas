# Welcome to the Medical School Atlas
## [Atlas portal](https://publish.obsidian.md/medschoolatlas/MedSchoolAtlas/README)
This is a lightweight and searchable medical school note database. The goal with this project is to provide a free alternative to overpriced medical education references.

This project is being built using my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notes as I am dragged kicking and screaming through the bloated and antiquated institution that is medical education.

## Note Taking Principals
1. Only include information necessary for passing
2. Information should strive to be concise and simple
3. Readability supersedes density
## Formatting Guidelines
These have not been fleshed out yet. Try to keep each related block of information in a dedicated header without being tangential. For example, even though the arm and leg circulatory systems  develop around the same time and look similar, they should be organized as independent concepts.

**The most important thing is always legibility of information.**
## Other information
These notes are updated using the Georgetown Medical School [curriculum](https://som.georgetown.edu/curriculum/journeyscurriculum/).
