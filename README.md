# Welcome to the Medical School Atlas
## [Knowledge Web](https://medschoolAtlas.xyz)

This project maintains lightweight and searchable medical school notes. The goal is to provide a free alternative to overpriced education materials with an emphasis on ease of understanding. Modern resources have made medical lecture obsolete.

# Note Taking Principles 
Notes follow the Georgetown Medical School [curriculum](https://som.georgetown.edu/curriculum/journeyscurriculum/) as I am dragged kicking and screaming through the bloated and antiquated institution that is medical education.

1. Required information is the only important information
3. [Readability supersedes density](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K-L9uhsBLM&t=52s)
4. Present information chronologically
5. Present information hierarchically
6. New concepts deserve definitions
7. Links are better than repeating information
8. Like information should be grouped together
9. Conceptually dense references require links
10. Don't panic
## Formatting Guidelines
These have not been fleshed out yet.
### Good article examples
- [[Fatty Acid and Ketone Metabolism]]
- [[Adrenergics]]
- [[Pharmacokinetics]]
### Headers
1. Top headers should be Pascal Case, subsequent headers should have only the first word capitalized.
3. Keep subheaders above four (>####).
4. Headers should not have line breaks before or after them.
### Lists
1. For most purposes, avoid nested bulleted lists.
###  Formulas
1. Formulas should be either a secondary or tertiary header.
2. Formulas should always have variables defined below.
### Tables
1. If the first column of a table has no header, italicize or bold all items within that column.
### Technicalities
1. Bacterial species should be *italicized*.
### Legibility
1. Break up long paragraphs.
2. **Bold** key terms.
3. Avoid using acronyms without defining them first (AUAWDTF).
### Quality of life
1. Only link to something within the site if it is the authority on the term/concept or the linked content directly relates to the topic.
