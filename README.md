# Welcome to the Medical School Atlas
## [Knowledge Web](https://medschoolAtlas.xyz)

This is a lightweight and searchable medical school note guide. The goal is to provide an free alternative to overpriced education materials with an emphasis on comprehensibility. Modern resources have made medical lecture obsolete.

These notes follow the Georgetown Medical School [curriculum](https://som.georgetown.edu/curriculum/journeyscurriculum/) as I am dragged kicking and screaming through the bloated and antiquated institution that is medical education. We are currently completing Block 1.
## Note Taking Principals
1. Required information is the only important information
3. [Readability supersedes density](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K-L9uhsBLM&t=52s)
4. Present information chronologically
5. Present information hierarchically
6. New concepts deserve definitions
7. Links are better than repeating information
8. Like information should be grouped together
9. Conceptually dense references require links
10. Don't panic
## Formatting Guidelines
These have not been fleshed out yet. Try to keep each related block of information in a dedicated header without being tangential. For example, even though the arm and leg circulatory systems  develop around the same time and look similar, they should be organized as independent concepts.

**The most important thing is always legibility of information.**
