# Welcome to the Medical School Atlas

This is a lightweight and searchable medical school note database. The goal with this project is to provide a free alternative to overpriced medical education references.

This project is being built using my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notes as I am dragged kicking and screaming through the bloated and antiquated institution that is medical education.

> These notes are open source and collaboration is more than welcome. If you find any information is missing, incorrect, or needs formatting, feel free to send a pull requests at [github.com/bjamturley/MedSchoolAtlas](https://github.com/bjamturley/MedSchoolAtlas)

These notes follow the Georgetown Medical School [curriculum](https://som.georgetown.edu/curriculum/journeyscurriculum/).
## Note Taking Principals
1. Required information is the only important information
3. [Readability supersedes density](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K-L9uhsBLM&t=52s)
4. Present information chronologically
5. Present information hierarchically
6. New concepts deserve definitions
7. Links are better than repeating information
8. Like information should be grouped together
9. Conceptually dense references require links
10. Don't panic
## Formatting Guidelines
These have not been fleshed out yet. Try to keep each related block of information in a dedicated header without being tangential. For example, even though the arm and leg circulatory systems  develop around the same time and look similar, they should be organized as independent concepts.

**The most important thing is always legibility of information.**
