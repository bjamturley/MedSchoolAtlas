Long term survival means that even if the patient is not 100% cancer free, their organ systems and disease is kept under control, and the patient will live longer. The idea of a cure suggests that the patient is no longer in remission.
# Mechanisms
## Mitotic Spindle Poisons
Arrest cells in the M phase of mitosis to inhibit the cell cycle.

**Vincristine**: Inhibits the polymerization of microtubules
**Paclitaxel**: Inhibits the de-polymerization of microtubules

*Note: Peripheral nerves require functioning microtubules for transport of signaling molecules and substrates, so altering polymerization in any way will affect peripheral nerve function.*
## DNA Adduct Forming Drugs
Chemically modify a strand of DNA to inhibit replication.

**Cyclophosphamide**: A prodrug activated in metabolism, resulting in alkylation at **guanines**, causing crosslinking and DNA damage and cell death. Can result in cystitis or bladder inflammation.
**Mechlorethamine**: ...
**Cisplatin and Oxaliplatin**: A prodrug activated in metabolism, resulting in alkylation of **adenines**, causing crosslinking and DNA damage and cell death. Can result in peripheral neuropathy and nephrotoxicity.
