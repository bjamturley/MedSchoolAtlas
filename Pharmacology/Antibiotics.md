# Lab Standards
**Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC)** is the minimal concentration of antibiotic that prevents the clear suspension $10^5$ CFU from becoming turbid after overnight inoculation. Essentially, the lowest level of antimicrobial agent resulting in microbial death.

The **Microbroth Dilution Method** is the gold standard for determining MIC. The three descriptive categories are S (sensitive), I (intermediate), and R (resistant).

For each bacterium and antibiotic combo, there will be a different specific MIC, known as the **MIC break point**. An **Antibiogram** tracks the resistance of different strains of bacteria in a specific location.
# Distribution
Knowing the distribution properties of a drug can help us choose a specific drug based on the site of the infection. A high distribution to a tissue compartment is often correlated with a low distribution in the blood or urine.

Pediatric patients have a higher proportion of water content, so **hydrophilic agents will distribute well in younger patients and lipophilic agents will not**. In obese patients, lipophilic agents may get trapped in adipose tissue.

**Hydrophilic antibiotics**: Beta Lactams, Aminoglycosides, Vancomycin
**Lipophilic antibiotics**: Quinolones, Oxazolidinones, SMX-TMP, Tetracyclines, Metronidazole
## Blood brain barrier
Many drugs cannot cross the BBB unless they are lipophilic and can diffuse across the membrane. Drugs with [[Pharmacokinetics#Drug diffusion|flow-limited distribution]] (lipophilic) are preferred.

*Permeable drugs*
- **3rd & 4th generation Cephalosporins**
- **Carbapenems**
- **SMX-TMP**
- **Quinolones**
- **Oxazolidinones**
- **Metronidazole**

*Non-permeable drugs*
- **Aminoglycosides**
- **Vancomycin**
- **Clindamycin**
- **Macrolides**
# Elimination
## Hepatic metabolism
It is difficult to quantify hepatic function; dose adjust for mod-severe impairment

*Examples*
- Macrolides
- Tetracyclines
- Clindamycin
## Renal metabolism
It is much easier to quantify renal function using CrCl and urine output. **Assume that these drugs are removed by hemodialysis** and require redosing after hemodialysis. For someone with impaired renal function, a much lower dose of antibiotics is required over a longer period of time.

*Examples*
- Beta-Lactams
- Quinolones
- Vancomycin
- Aminoglycosides
# Pharmacodynamics
## Time-dependent microbials
Duration of antimicrobial exposure is most important for these drugs and optimal bactericidal activity occurs when serum drug level reaches a dosing threshold (usually 4-5x the MIC). **Higher drug levels do not increase the rate or extent of bacterial killing**.

*Examples*
- Beta-lactams: Penicillins, Cephalosporins, Carbapenems
## Concentration-dependent microbials
Concentration of drug is most important with these drugs for bacteriologic eradication and **the higher the drug concentration, the greater the rate and extent of bacterial killing**.

*Examples*
- Aminoglycosides
- Fluoroquinolones
- Vancomycin
# Dosing Nomograms
Find the point of intersection between the delivered dosage and the time since infusion. This point corresponds with the time of dose.

In the example below, an checking serum concentration 10 hours after an initial dose of 7mg/kg would correspond with the interval q36h, or a subsequent dose recommended in 36 hours.
