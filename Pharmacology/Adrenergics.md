The [[Nervous System Primer#Autonomic Nervous System|sympathetic nervous system]] emerges from the thoracic-lumbar region of the spine. It will synapse with sympathetic chain ganglia and [[Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)#Organization|release norepinephrine]] on targets. 

**Pre-ganglionic neurons** synapse with the Adrenal Medulla which releases epinephrine and norepinephrine into the blood
**Post-ganglionic neurons** release dopamine for renal smooth muscle.
# Receptors
See here for a primer on signaling subunits s, i, and q: [[Signal Transduction Primer#Guanine binding proteins]]
## Alpha 1 (Sympathetic)
Found in the **eyes, gastrointestinal system, and prostate**. Dilates eyes, decreases gastrointestinal motility, contracts prostate (A1A), through vasoconstriction.

Alpha 1 receptors are innervated via **sympathetic tone** which increases [[Autonomic Nervous System Effects Primer#Heart Circulation|total peripheral resistance]] (and diastolic blood pressure), as well as venous tone (and systolic blood pressure).

**Muscle contraction mechanism**
*Gq → phospholipase C → Ca2+ → contraction*
### Clinical pearl: Benign prostatic hyperplasia
Blocking Alpha 1 activation can relax the prostate, which makes it easier for patients with BPH to urinate. The drug in question is **Tamsulosin**.
## Alpha 2A (Parasympathetic)
These are **inhibitory** receptors. They are found in the **vasomotor center of the medulla (CNS) and pre-synaptic terminals**.

In the **CNS**, A2A inhibits **Sympathetic Cardiovascular Outflow** (generally decreasing all things heart).

In **pre-synaptic terminals**, A2A **downregulates norepinephrine/acetylcholine**, preventing stimulation of the SNS/PNS. Norepinephrine released from nerve terminals come back to bind at an A2A receptor, regulating the output.

A2A is important for **reciprocal inhibition** between the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. For example, when the sympathetic system is upregulated, it will cross signal to an A2A receptor in the parasympathetic system to downregulate it and vice versa.

## Alpha 2B (Sympathetic)
Found in blood vessels. These vasoconstrict (increasing total peripheral resistance). 

**Muscle contraction mechanism**
*Gi → decrease adenylyl cyclase → decrease cAMP → contraction*
## Beta 1 (Sympathetic)
Found in the heart and kidneys. Increases all things heart as well as renin in the kidneys and blood volume.

**Muscle contraction mechanism**
*Gs → increase adenylyl cyclase → increase cAMP → relaxation*
## Beta 2 (Sympathetic)
Has much **higher affinity for epinephrine** than norepinephrine. Found in the **heart, lungs, liver, and blood vessels in skeletal muscle/liver**. It will increase heart rate, bronchodilate, and dilate vessels in the skeletal muscles and liver.

**Muscle contraction mechanism**
*Gs → increase adenylyl cyclase → increase cAMP → relaxation*
## Beta 3 (Sympathetic)
Found in **bladder and fat cells**. Decreases bladder smooth muscle contraction (increasing urine retention) as well as decreasing [[Hormonal Regulation of Metabolism#Catecholamines (Norepinephrine/Epinephrine|lipolysis and release of free fatty acids)]].

**Muscle contraction mechanism**
*Gs → increase adenylyl cyclase → increase cAMP → relaxation*
## Dopamine 1
Found in renal vasculature and smooth muscle. Relaxes renal vasculature and smooth muscle.

**Muscle contraction mechanism**
*Gs → increase adenylyl cyclase → increase cAMP → relaxation*
# Catecholamine Metabolism
See here for the catecholamine synthesis enzymes: [[Synaptic Cell Biology#Key Neurotransmitter Metabolism]]

TL;DR
- Tyrosine → DOPA (via **tyrosine hydroxylase**) →→ neurotransmitter
- **Tyrosine hydroxylase** is the rate limiting step and requires the cofactor BH4
- Dopamine → Norepinephrine occurs inside the vesicle
- **VMAT1/2** transport norepinephrine into the cell
- Norepinephrine is degraded by **COMT/MAO**

The production of catecholamines can be upregulated by phosphorylation of TH, which increases affinity for BH4. It can also be upregulated by transcription factors.
## Clinical pearl: Reducing catecholamine levels
**Tyrosine hydroxylase** is the rate limiting step for catecholamine formation, which is useful to inhibit when there is overactive production of catecholamines like in the case of an Adrenal Medulla tumor. **Metyrosine** will do just that.

Catecholamines are transported into vesicles by **VMAT**, which can be targeted pharmacologically. This will decrease catecholamine levels as they will be degraded by an MAO if not protected in a vesicle.
## Clinical pearl: Increasing norepinephrine effect
The transporter for norepinephrine is **NET**. This can be inhibited by drugs like **cocaine** and some anti-depressants. Blocking NET produces a prolonged effect in the synapse.

When catecholamines arrive back into the cell, they are degraded by MAO (in neurons) or COMT (in effector cells). **MAO inhibitors** will also increase the effect of catecholamines.

Finally, **blocking A2A receptors** will stop the negative feedback on norepinephrine release.
## Clinical pearl: L-DOPA
L-DOPA is used instead of dopamine for the treatment of **Parkinson's** because it can cross the blood brain barrier while dopamine cannot.
# Blood Pressure
Take a gander at this for an autonomic blood pressure review: [[Autonomic Nervous System Effects Primer#Heart Circulation]].

**Cardiac muscle**
*Increase in cAMP → Contraction (B1 - Heart)*
*Decrease in cAMP → Relaxation (M2 - Heart)*

**Smooth muscle**
*Increase in cAMP → Relaxation (B2 - e.g. Bronchi)*
*Decrease in cAMP → Contraction (A1 - e.g. Vasculature)*
## Baroreceptor Reflex
Allows the body to quickly maintain blood pressure so that we don't need to mess around with hormones and receptors.

There are **stretch receptors** in the **carotids and aortic arch**. This information is relayed down the Vagus Nerve to adjust heart rate. **Baroreceptor tone** is the constant signal the brain receives the stretch receptors.

*Spike in blood pressure → decrease heart rate → decrease cardiac output (→ systolic blood pressure)*

Secondarily, A2A receptors in the vasomotor center in the brain will trigger vasodilation, decreasing total peripheral resistance (→ diastolic blood pressure) and cardiac output (→ systolic blood pressure)
## Food for thought
What if an A1 agonist (**phenylephrine**) was given and then [[Cholinergics#Atropine|atropine]]?

The baroreceptor signal would still be sensed by the brain, but it won't be able to transmit the signal to increase heart rate as the muscarinic receptors on the Vagus Nerve will be inhibited by the atropine.
# Direct Catecholamine Action
## Norepinephrine
Stimulates A1, A2B, B1, and B3 receptors (not B2).

A1/A2B → increase blood pressure
B1 → increase all things heart → increase blood pressure

As blood pressure spikes, heart rate drops to compensate.
## Epinephrine (Low Dose)
Stimulates all Alpha and Beta receptors. At a low dose, B2/B1 will predominate in response.

B2 → vasodilation → lower diastolic blood pressure
B1 → increased heart rate / cardiac output → higher systolic blood pressure

No baroreceptor reflex response as mean blood pressure remains the same.
# B1 Selective Agonists
## Dobutamine
Increases contractility (through renin in the kidney) more than heart rate. Short duration of action (1-2 mins) which is useful for **heart failure**.
## Isoproterenol
Selective B1 and B2 agonist. 

Stimulation of B2 in skeletal muscle results in vasodilation and a big drop in diastolic blood pressure. Stimulation of B1 in the heart increases heart rate and raises systolic blood pressure.

Baroreceptor reflex is still triggered from the big diastolic drop, increasing heart rate.
# B2 Selective Agonists
## Albuterol, Terbutaline, Ritodrine
Unusually inhaled, which increases bronchodilation for the treatment of **asthma**.

Being selective for B2 is good because only 20% of Beta receptors in the heart are B2. This prevents an increase in cardiac demand when in a low oxygen state (i.e. and asthma attack).
## Isoproterenol
Selective B1 and B2 agonist. 

Stimulation of B2 in skeletal muscle results in vasodilation and a big drop in diastolic blood pressure. Stimulation of B1 in the heart increases heart rate and raises systolic blood pressure.

Baroreceptor reflex is still triggered from the big diastolic drop, increasing heart rate.
# A1 Selective Agonists
## Phenylephrine
Creates systemic vasoconstriction, increasing blood pressure and triggering the baroreceptor reflex.

Used as a nasal spray for **nasal decongestant**. Overuse can lead to rebound hyperemia.
# A2 Partial Agonists
## Clonidine and alpha-methyldopa
Cause vasoconstriction through A2B (via IV administration). However, if it acts on A2A in the CNS (vasomotor center) or presynaptic neurons, it reduces the concentration of catecholamines and drops blood pressure.
## Brimonidine
Decreases aqueous humor production, lowering intraocular pressure.

Used for treatment of **glaucoma**.
# Alpha Antagonists
For Phentolamine, see here: [[Adrenergics#Phentolamine]]
## Phenoxybenzamine
**Irreversible** A1 and A2 antagonist.

Used in **extreme cases of vasoconstriction, like frostbite**.
## Prazosin
A1A, A1B, A1D antagonist.

Used to treat **hypertension**.
## Tamsulosin (FLOMAX)
A1A antagonist. A1A receptors are only present in the prostate.

Used to treat **benign prostatic hyperplasia**.
# Beta Antagonists
Beta blockers. lol.

**Uses**
- *Hypertension* (decreases cardiac output)
- *Angina* (decreases heart rate / oxygen demand)
- *Arrhythmias* (decreases conduction)
- *Heart failure* (decreases heart stimulation generally)
- *Glaucoma* (decreases aqueous humor production)
- *Migraines*
- *Post-MI workup*
## Propranolol
Non-selective B1 and B2 antagonist.

Chronic use can lead to disuse supersensitivity.
## Metoprolol/Atenolol
Selective B1 antagonist.

Has better tolerance for exercise as B2 isn't blocked which allows for vasodilation of skeletal muscle. No bronchoconstriction as well.
## Timolol
B1 and B2 antagonist. Used for **glaucoma**.
## Pindolol
Weak B1 and B2 partial agonist. Partial agonism will decrease heart rate by moderately stimulating B1.
# Combined A1 and Beta Antagonists
## Carvedilol
Decreases total peripheral resistance, diastolic blood pressure, and therefore reduces hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes.

Used for **moderate heart failure**.
## Labetalol
Does not have hyperproliferative properties like carvedilol.

Treats **hypertension during pregnancy** and **hypertensive emergencies**.
# Drugs Targeting Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH)
## Metyrosine
Competitive inhibitor of TH: **Decreases** catecholamines.

Used for **pheochromocytomas** (catecholamine secreting tumors)
## L-DOPA
Increases substrates after TH: **Increases** catecholamines.

Used for **Parkinson's disease** and for **TH deficiencies**.
# Drugs Inhibiting Catecholamine Storage
## Reserpine
Blocks VMAT1, inhibiting uptake and resulting in degradation: **Decreases** catecholamines.

Previously used for schizophrenia and hypertension, but is **no longer used**.
## Tetrabenazine
Blocks VMAT2, inhibiting uptake and resulting in degradation: **Decreases** catecholamines.

Used in CNS disorders like **Huntington's disease**, **tardive dyskinesia**, and **Tourette's**.
# Drugs Inhibiting Catecholamine Release
## Clonidine
A2A and A2C agonist, decreasing cAMP resulting in hyperpolarization: **Decreases** catecholamines.

Used as an **antihypertensive**.
## Botulinum toxin
Blocks VAMP/SNAP-25, which prevents vesicular docking: **Decreases** catecholamines.

Used (in small doses) for **cerebral palsy**, **spasticity**, and **excess sweating**.
# Drugs Increasing Catecholamine Release
## Tyramine
Displaces norepinephrine from cytoplasm: **Increases** catecholamines.

Not prescribed, but is **consumed (red wine, cheese, yogurts)** which is why patients on MAO inhibitors must avoid these foods to prevent potentially lethal hypertension.
## Amphetamines
Inhibit reuptake pumps, VMAT, and MAO: **Increases** catecholamines.

Note: VMAT is blocked by reserpine to decrease catecholamines. Amphetamines have the opposite effect as the amphetamine buildup in the cytosol is so great, the pumps reverse and, independent of Ca2+ signaling, start moving the drug out of the cell.

Used for **ADHD** and **narcolepsy**. Tolerance develops quickly, strong abuse potential.
## Ephedrine/Pseudoephedrine
Drug enters via the reuptake pump, displacing norepinephrine from the cytoplasm: **Increases** catecholamines.

Also a weak B receptor agonist. Precursor to amphetamines. Chronic usage may cause **downregulation of alpha receptors** and result in **nasal blood vessel dilation**.

Used as **OTC cold medication** and **weight loss**.
# Drugs Inhibiting Catecholamine Reuptake
## Cocaine
Inhibits norepinephrine/dopamine/serotonin transporters: **Increases** catecholamines.

Used as a **party lubricant** and for taking **long looks in the mirror**.
## Desipramine
Inhibits norepinephrine/serotonin transporters: **Increases** catecholamines.

This drug is not abused like cocaine because it does not act on dopamine.

Used as **antidepressants (tricyclic class)**. Will pharmacologically inhibit Ephedrine/Pseudoephedrine.
# Drugs Inhibiting MAOIs
## Phenelzine
Inhibits MAO-A and MAO-B, reducing catecholamine degradation: **Increases** catecholamines.

Used as a 3rd line **antidepressant**.
## Selegiline
Inhibits MAO-B, reducing catecholamine degradation: **Increases** catecholamines.

Used as an adjunctive treatment for **Parkinson's** (MAO-B degrades dopamine).
# Drugs Inhibiting Phosphodiesterases (PDEs)
PDEs break down cAMP/cGMP. By inhibiting these, the cAMP/cGMP signals remain high.
## Aminophylline/Theophylline
**Increases** catecholamine SIGNAL via PDE-4.

Used for **asthma** and **COPD**. Can result in tachycardia.
## Sildenafil/Vardenafil/Tadalafil
**Increases** catecholamine SIGNAL via PDE-5.

Used for **erectile dysfunction** and **pulmonary hypertension**.
# Vasodilators
## Phentolamine
Blocks A1 and A2. Reduces total peripheral resistance (systolic) and venus return (diastolic).

The drop in blood pressure **triggers the baroreceptor reflex**, increasing heart rate.
## Epinephrine (High Dose)
Stimulates A1 and A2b, constricting blood vessels. This increases total peripheral resistance (systolic) and venus return (diastolic).

*Note: Because B2 has a higher affinity for epinephrine than Alpha receptors, for **low dose epinephrine** vasodilation will occur in the periphery and total peripheral resistance will drop. However, there is no net change in blood pressure (systolic increases from increased cardiac output), and **won't result in baroreceptor reflex correction**.*
## Epinephrine + Phentolamine
**Phentolamine inhibits Alpha receptors**, resulting in a reduction in total peripheral resistance (systolic) and venus return (diastolic).

Because **epinephrine can no longer bind to Alpha receptors**, it **only affects the heart through Beta receptors**, increasing heart rate. 

Additionally, B2 stimulation will lead to vasodilation, reducing total peripheral resistance (systolic) and venus return (diastolic), dropping blood pressure and further increasing heart rate.
