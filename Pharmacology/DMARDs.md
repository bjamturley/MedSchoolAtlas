Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs.
# Hydroxychloroquine
Standard therapy in lupus. Used with other agents in **rheumatoid arthritis (RA)**. 

The mechanism of action is unclear but is thought to **alter the pH in lysosomes** and/or affect **toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling**.
## Side effects
- Retinal toxicity and vision loss
# Sulfasalazine
Used in combination with other agents for **RA**.

The mechanism of action is unclear. There are **frequent allergies to this drug** due to the sulfa component.
## Side effects
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Loss of appetite
- Abdominal pain
# Minocycline
Used for **RA patients with (+) rheumatoid factor**.

Thought to act at the level of **metalloproteinases** and may have some **antimicrobial effects**.
## Side effects
- Dizziness
- Vestibular toxicity
- Nausea
- Hepatitis
# Methotrexate
**Major treatment for RA** as it is well tolerated. It's discontinuation rate is lower than other drugs.

**Blocks the folic acid synthesis pathway**, so use includes folic acid and [[Cancer Drugs#Methotrexate & Leucovorin|Leucovorin]] to reduce side effects.

Monitoring includes **CBC and comprehensive metabolic panels**, especially liver enzymes. Contraindicated in patients with **renal insufficiency and pregnancy**.
# Azathioprine
Used more in **lupus** and **vasculitis** compared versus RA. Also has a role in **transplant medicine** to prevent rejection.

The prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine.
## Side effects
- GI intolerance
- Bone marrow suppression
- Increased risk of viral infections
# Leflunomide
**Alternative to methotrexate to treat RA**. Once a day tablet.

Works on dihydroorotate pathways. Does not induce bone marrow suppression or predisposition to opportunistic infections. 

**Very long half-life** due to [[Pharmacokinetics|hepatobiliary secretion and reabsorption]]. Can be eliminated with the help of **cholestyramine/bile salts**.
# Mycophenolate Mofetil
Used in **lupus with corresponding kidney inflammation**.

Reversible **inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase** which **downregulates synthesis of guanosine nucleotides in T and B lymphocytes**.
# Tofacitinib
Used for RA.

JAK3 inhibitor. Absence of JAK3 causes [[Immunodeficiency Diseases#Combined B and T cell deficiencies|SCID]]. Side effects include immune suppression and increased cholesterol.
# Biologic Response Modifiers
Proteins derived from living material. 50% of people with RA can be treated with traditional oral agents, while biologics cover the other 50%.
## TNF-alpha inhibitors
Metalloproteinases cleave membrane bound TNF receptors to bind soluble TNF which dampens the inflammatory signal. **All anti-TNF drugs work well in RA**.

Anti-TNF drugs also **treat joint pain of ankylosing spondylitis**.

Monoclonal antibodies assist with **Crohn’s disease and uveitis**. Monoclonals also work better on the skin in **psoriasis**. Both monoclonal antibodies and fusion receptors work well with **inflammatory arthritis**.
### Lenercept
...
### Infliximab
Used for **Crohn’s disease**. Stop-start dosing results in a higher development of antibodies to the drug. Co-administration of immunosuppressive drugs **significantly reduce the anti-drug antibodies**.
## T-Cell Costimulatory Blockade
Blocks T-cell costimulatory signal.
### Abatacept
Slow onset, well tolerated, moderately effective
## Anti-CD20
Targets CD20 molecules on B cells, ultimately destroying them.
### Rituximab
**Works with RA and other autoimmune diseases**. Works well in **granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA)**.

Side effects include mild to severe infusion reactions, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (through viral reactivation), Reactivation of Hepatitis B
## Interleukin Receptor Antagonists
Reduction of IL-1 and IL-6 which drive the production of C reactive protein and other inflammatory conditions.
### Anakinra
Recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist. **Moderately effective for RA**. **Effective at stopping gout**.

Daily shot that causes uncomfortable welts. Other side effects include infections and neutropenia.
### Tocilizumab
Anti-IL-6. Used for **RA, JIA, and Castleman’s disease**.

Side effects include infections, blood pressure elevation, and elevated liver enzymes.
## B-Lymphocyte Stimulator (BLyS) inhibitors
### Belimumab
**Blocks BLyS**, which normally helps to keep B cells alive. Somewhat effective in **lupus**.
## Pegloticase
PEGylated to extend half-life and reduce immunogenicity. Dramatically reduces serum uric acid to **prevent gout outbreaks**. Add methotrexate when antibodies develop.
# Treat To Target
Directed trial and error.
*Diagnose → Treat → Measure → Monitor*
## Primary drug failure
When the drug does not work.

**Solutions**
- Choose another drug class
- Review diagnosis
## Secondary drug failure
When a drug initially works but later loses effect.

**Solutions**
- Increase dose
- Shorten interval
- Choose another drug or target
