# Acetylcholine (Ach)
Created by combining Acetyl-CoA and choline via [[Synaptic Cell Biology#Key Neurotransmitter Metabolism|choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)]]. It is released with a Ca2+ influx and binds to **Nicotinic** or **Muscarinic** receptors. 

After binding, ACh leaves the receptor and is cleaved into choline and acetate via **ACh Esterase (AChE)**. The choline is recycled back into the post-synaptic neuron.

**Botulinum Toxin (Botox)** disrupts vesicle fusion proteins at the NMJ, blocking release of ACh from the vesicle.
## Structure
Ach has **two charged centers** which make it polar. This limits absorption across the GI tract and means it cannot be taken orally or cross cell membranes.
# Receptors
## Muscarinic
G protein coupled (GPCR) which are slower acting and take longer to reach the effect. They have structural differences and cannot currently be targeted individually.

**M1 (q)**: Higher cognitive functions, enteric nervous system
**M2 (i)**: Decreased heart rate and contractility of atria
**M3 (q)**: Increased exocrine gland secretions, peristalsis, bladder contraction, bronchoconstriction, pupillary sphincter muscle contraction (miosis), ciliary muscle contraction (accommodation), insulin release, vasodilation

The **q subunit** receptors proceed down the [[Signal Transduction Primer#IP3 and DAG|IP3-DAG]] pathway while the **i subunit** receptor proceeds down the [[Signal Transduction Primer#Cyclic nucleotides#cAMP|cAMP]] pathway.

*Note: M3 does not act on smooth muscle receptors directly, as that would cause them to contract. Instead, they use **downstream Nitric Oxide (NO) which diffuses to the smooth muscle** and increases cGMP, causing relaxation.*

## Nicotinic
These are ligand-gated ion channels which cause depolarization at the target.

**Neuronal** receptors are located on the **ganglia**, **adrenal medulla**, and **CNS**.
**Muscular** receptors are located at the **neuromuscular junction** on muscle cells.

# Dose-Response
The autonomic effects will not be seen at the same dosage of cholinergic drugs. This is the reason Ach cannot be injected to solve NMJ disorders (i.e., **Myasthenia Gravis**), as the high required dosage will have side effects.

# Muscarinic Agonists (Parasympathetic)
Stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system. The following either have an extra methyl group, a terminal NH2 group, or both which makes it harder to break down by AchE.
## Bethanechol
Taken orally after surgery to restart GI activity. Will also open urinary smooth muscle.
## Pilocarpine
Stimulates sweat, tears, and saliva which is good for **closed-angle glaucoma** and **xerostomia (Sjogren syndrome)**. Also used as eye drops for **Presbyopia** (age related vision deficits).
## Methacholine
Stimulates airway, causing wheezing. Challenge test for **asthma**.
## Carbachol
Constricts the pupil and relieves intraocular pressure, which is good for **open-angle glaucoma**.
# Cholinesterase Inhibitors (Parasympathetic)
**Acetylcholinesterase (AchE)** is found in the synaptic cleft, red blood cells, placenta, and tendons. **Plasma cholinesterase** is non-specific and will metabolize any ester.
## Carbamic acid derivatives
Steric hinderance from nitrogen makes it hard to release the final products, slowing down the esterase reaction and **increasing concentration of Ach**.
## Physostigmine
Original **carbamic acid derivative**. Can be taken orally.
## Neostigmine
Used in operating rooms to **reverse curare**.
## Pyridostigmine
Used to **treat myasthenia gravis** by blocking breakdown of Ach.
## Rivastigmie & Donepezil
Medications used to treat **Alzheimer's disease** which is caused by degeneration of cholinergic nerves. This will prolong cognitive function.
## Edrophonium
Used in operating rooms to **reverse curare**.
## Clinical Pearl: Reversing Curare
Giving AchE inhibitors to increase the amount of Ach will reverse the effects of curare at the NMJ. To insure the Ach doesn't also affect muscarinic targets, an anticholinergic like atropine can be administered to inhibit those receptors.
# Organophosphates (Parasympathetic)
These are also cholinesterase inhibitors, but will permanently (irreversibly) shut off AchE.
## Echothiopate
The only AchE with a phosphate group used in medicine. Given as eye drops for **treatment of glaucoma**.
## Chemical warfare agents
WWII era weapons. **Thoughtful gifts** for kids younger than 7. Can be treated with **pralidoxime**.
# Muscarinic Antagonists
Also known as antimuscarinics or anticholinergics. Stimulates the sympathetic nervous system via blocking the parasympathetic.
## Atropine
Can cross the blood brane barrier can cause mental fog and confusion. Used in surgery to **reduce saliva** and can be used as treatment for **mushroom poisoning**. Can also be used in emergencies to **treat bradycardia**.
## Scopolamine
Used for **motion sickness**.
## Homatropine
Used as eye drops for **pupil dilation**.
## Ipratropium/tiotropium
Administered through insufflation via an inhaler to **dilatate bronchioles/reduce secretions**.
## Tolterodine
Treats **overactive bladder**. Has dry mouth, constipation, headache, and stomach pain as side effects.
## Glycopyrronium
Treats **hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating)**. Has dry mouth, blurred vision, and urinary retention as side effects.
# Nicotinic Antagonists (Sympathetic)
Either block nicotinic muscle receptors or nicotinic neuronal receptors. Drugs which have charge centers **10C apart** will block muscle receptors while charge centers **6C apart** will block neuronal receptors.
## Curare
Competitive antagonist of Ach. Decreases size of excitatory potential and does not generate action potential, resulting in **muscle paralysis**.
## Hexamethonium
Discontinued ganglionic blocking drug.
## Trimethaphan & Mecamylamine
Ganglionic blocking drugs. Diffuse mechanism which used to be used for severe hypertension.
