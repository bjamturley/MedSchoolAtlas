# Acetylcholine (Ach)
Created by combining Acetyl-CoA and choline via [[Synaptic Cell Biology#Key Neurotransmitter Metabolism|choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)]]. It is released with a Ca2+ influx and binds to **Nicotinic** or **Muscarinic** receptors. 

After binding, ACh leaves the receptor and is cleaved into choline and acetate via **ACh Esterase (AChE)**. The choline is recycled back into the post-synaptic neuron.

**Botulinum Toxin (Botox)** disrupts vesicle fusion proteins at the NMJ, blocking release of ACh from the vesicle.
## Structure
Ach has **two charged centers** which make it polar. This limits absorption across the GI tract and means it cannot be taken orally or cross cell membranes.
# Receptors
## Muscarinic
G protein coupled (GPCR) which are slower acting and take longer to reach the effect. They have structural differences and cannot currently be targeted individually.

**M1 (q)**: Higher cognitive functions, enteric nervous system
**M2 (i)**: Decreased heart rate and contractility of atria
**M3 (q)**: Increased exocrine gland secretions, peristalsis, bladder contraction, bronchoconstriction, pupillary sphincter muscle contraction (miosis), ciliary muscle contraction (accommodation), insulin release, vasodilation

The **q subunit** receptors proceed down the [[Signal Transduction Primer#IP3 and DAG|IP3-DAG]] pathway while the **i subunit** receptor proceeds down the [[Signal Transduction Primer#Cyclic nucleotides#cAMP|cAMP]] pathway.

*Note: M3 does not act on smooth muscle receptors directly, as that would cause them to contract. Instead, they use **downstream Nitric Oxide (NO) which diffuses to the smooth muscle** and increases cGMP, causing relaxation.*

## Nicotinic
These are ligand-gated ion channels which cause depolarization at the target.

**Neuronal** receptors are located on the **ganglia**, **adrenal medulla**, and **CNS**.
**Muscular** receptors are located at the **neuromuscular junction** on muscle cells.

# Dose-Response
The autonomic effects will not be seen at the same dosage of cholinergic drugs. This is the reason Ach cannot be injected to solve NMJ disorders (i.e., **Myasthenia Gravis**), as the high required dosage will have side effects.
