# Amphotericin B
**Binds to ergosterol** to attack the cell wall. Poor GI absorption, so it is always given via IV. Only given for severe, systemic, life-threatening fungal infections
## Amphotericin B deoxycholate
First generation. Nephrotoxic.
## Amphotericin B lipid preparation
More commonly used. Less nephrotoxic.
## Toxicity
Can cause acute symptoms of fever, rigors, hypotension, tachypnea, and thrombophlebitis. Chronically, kidney damage and electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, metabolic acidosis) can occur.
# Flucytosine (5-FC)
Converted in fungal cells to 5-FU which **inhibits Thymidylate Synthetase, required for DNA synthesis**.

It is **the empiric treatment of [[Mycology#Cryptococcus|Cryptococcal meningitis]]** and used in conjunction with Amphotericin B. After 2 weeks, Fluconazole is used as maintenance therapy to prevent relapse.
# Azoles
**Inhibits ergosterol synthesis** via Lanosine-14-alpha demethylase, attacking the cell membrane.

Worth noting is that azoles **can inhibit CYP3A4 and CYP2C9**, which will increase drug concentration.
## Fluconazole
Treats yeast infections, especially *[[Mycology#Candida|Candida]]*, *[[Mycology#Cryptococcus|Cryptococcus]]*, and *[[Mycology#Coccidioidomycosis (Coccidioides immitus)|Coccidioides immitis]]*. Has high oral bioavailability. However, it has **teratogenic effects**.

Used for **Cryptococcal meningitis maintenance therapy** (after Flucytosine).
## Itraconazole
Not used as often any more because of low bioavailability. Must be taken with an acidic beverage.

Good for the endemic mycoses after initial treatment with Amphotericin B.
## Voriconazole
Covers a wide range of fungi, but is **the optimal treatment for [[Mycology#Aspergillus|Aspergillus]]**.

Side effects include abnormal liver biomarkers (AST/ALT), visual effects (color perception is off), photosensitivity, and [[Dermatologic Neoplastic Diseases#Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Squamous Cell Carcinoma]].
## Posaconazole
Covers a wide range of fungi, including *[[Mycology#Candida|Candida]]*, *[[Mycology#Aspergillus|Aspergillus]]* and *[[Mycology#Mucormycosis|Mucormycosis]]*.
## Isavuconazole
Newer azole, good for *[[Mycology#Aspergillus|Aspergillus]]* and *[[Mycology#Mucormycosis|Mucormycosis]]*.
# Echinocandins
**Attacks the fungal cell wall (Glucan) directly**. Echinocandins inhibit 1, 3-beta-D-glucan synthase.
## Caspofungin, Micafungin, and Anidulafungin
Targets *[[Mycology#Candida|Candida]]* and is especially indicated for Azole resistant Candida. Only administered via IV.
# Griseofulvin
Binds to microtubules, and inhibits mitosis in metaphase. A topical antifungal used for [[Mycology#Dermatophytes|Dermatophytes]].
