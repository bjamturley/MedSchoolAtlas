# Central nervous system (CNS)
**Brain**
- Cerebrum (telencephalon): Cortex, subcortical structures
- Diencephalon: Thalamus, hypothalamus
- Brain stem: Midbrain, pons, medulla oblongata
- Cerebellum

**Spinal cord**
- Cervical
- Thoracic
- Lumbar
- Sacral
## Functions
## Forebrain (telencephalon and diencephalon)
Responsible for higher order processing (language memory, thought, emotion), sensory processing, motor output to skeletal muscle and viscera, autonomic glands
## Brain stem
Responsible for lower level functions (breathing, cardiac regulation) as well as some sensory and motor functions
## Spinal cord
Facilitates sensory and motor functions via cranial and spinal nerves (PNS)
# Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)
Composed of cranial and spinal nerves which connect the CNS to muscles, glands, organs, and sensory tissue.

**Sensory (afferent - arrive) neurons**: Send signal to CNS
**Motor (efferent - exit) neurons**: Send signal from CNS

For a more detailed primer, see here: [[Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)]]
For anatomical detail, see here: [[Nervous System Primer#Autonomic nervous system]]
## Autonomic nervous system
Responsible for involuntary movement, carries signal from CNS

- **Sympathetic nervous system**: Flight or flight
- **Parasympathetic nervous system**: Rest and digest
- **Enteric nervous system**: GI tract

For general effects, see here: [[Autonomic Nervous System Effects Primer]]
## Somatic nervous system
Responsible for voluntary muscle movement in skeletal muscle
# White and Gray Matter
White matter contains myelinated axons whereas gray matter contains unmyelinated axons.
## Gray matter
**CNS**: Makes up the outer cortex and are arranged as nuclei
**PNS**: Organized into ganglia
## White matter
**CNS**: Organized into tracts (axon bundles) or columns (several tracts)
**PNS**: Organized into nerves (axon bundles)

# Neuron Classification
**Multipolar**: Most common variant in humans. Dendrites > Cell Body > Axon.
**Bipolar**: Dendrites > Axon > Cell Body > Axon > Dendrites
**Pseudounipolar**: Cell Body > Two Axons > Dendrites
**Unipolar**: Cell Body > Axon > Dendrites

## Functions
**Excitation**: Increase the likelihood the target will fire (e.g. glutamate)
**Inhibitory**: Decrease the likelihood the target will fire (e.g. gamma-aminobutyric acid GABA)
**Modulatory**: Modify the probability the target neuron will fire (e.g. dopamine, [[Synaptic Cell Biology#Key Neurotransmitter Metabolism|serotonin]], [[Synaptic Cell Biology#Key Neurotransmitter Metabolism|acetylcholine]])

# Other Cell Types
**Ependymal cells**: Make up choroid plexus lining the ventricles of the brain. Produces cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
**Pial cells**: Make up pia mater lining the surface of the brain (innermost lining of meninges)
**Vascular cells**: Blood circulation
# Clinical Pearls
## CNS disorders
- **Alzheimer's Disease**: Atrophy of brain tissue, affects memory and cognitive functioning
- **Glioblastoma**: Aggressive form of cancer affecting astrocytes in the brain
- **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**: Demyelination (loss of white matter) in the brain and spinal cord
## PNS disorders
- **Diabetic neuropathy**: Chronically elevated glucose which can damage nerves (usually of hands and feel)
- **Schwannoma**: Benign tumor affecting Schwann cells
- **Sciatica**: Pain radiating along sciatic nerve
