# Chemical Synapse
Presynaptic neuron sends signal to a postsynaptic neuron via neurotransmitters. The **synaptic cleft** refers to the space between cells (20-40 nm).
## Post-synaptic receptors
- **Ionotropic**: Ligand-gated ion channels. Quickly alter membrane potential.
- **Metabotropic**: G-protein coupled. Result in signal cascade which have slow, but long lasting inner-cell effects.
## Neurotransmitter release
Neurotransmitters are released via exocytosis. This process is **calcium dependent** and occurs when an [[Ion channels and Action Potentials#Anatomy of an action potential|action potential]] opens a **voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC)**. The concentration of calcium is much higher outside the cell.

Vesicles fuse with the target cell using **SNARE proteins**, specifically **synaptotagmin** which is a Ca2+ sensor. Tetanus and botulinum toxin (Botox) inhibit SNARE function

Vesicles are recycled into the receiving cell via endocytosis. This process is [[Primer - Cells and Organelles#Transport out of ER|clatherin-dependent]].

*Note: Serotonin will bind to both CNS and PNS targets. PNS targets can include bone remodeling, lipolysis, glucose metabolism, bone marrow, and the gut microbiome.*
