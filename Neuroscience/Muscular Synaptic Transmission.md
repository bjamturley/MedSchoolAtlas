# Neuromuscular Junction (NMJ)
*Motor information → spinal cord → ventral horn → somatic spinal nerve → myocyte (muscle)*

A synapse between a motor neuron and a muscle. Communicates via [[Synaptic Cell Biology#Key Neurotransmitter Mechanisms|acetylcholine (ACh)]]. The post-synaptic neuron (on muscle cell) has **junctional folds** which increase the surface area of the synaptic cleft and increase the number of receptors. These also decrease the distance between cells, cutting down on travel time.
## Electrical events
When activated, sodium enters the through the acetylcholine receptor (potassium won't move much because it sits around resting potential). This will depolarize the membrane (end plate) at the NMJ enough the trigger an action potential. The potential change is graded (not all-or-nothing) as more receptor activation results in more depolarization local to where the receptors are.

A **quanta** is the smallest unit of neurotransmitter which can be released at a time. The more quanta, the more depolarization. 
- **Quantal size**: Response to one vesicle
- **Quantal content**: Number of vesicles released from the post-synaptic nerve
- **M**: Mean amplitude of responses
## Reverse potential
As sodium enters the cell with an action potential, potassium will leave to stabilize the electrical gradient. This creates an electrical potential of 0 mV all told.
## Miniature spontaneous synaptic events (MINIs)
There is the possibility the post-synaptic cell can experience spontaneous depolarization which occurs when individual ACh vesicles are released from the presynaptic cell without a presynaptic action potential (oops). 

As the number of vesicles (and quanta of ACh) released will always be enough to trigger an action potential (e.g. the **safety factor**), this spontaneous event will affect the post-synaptic cell.
# Acetylcholine Receptor
Made of 5 subunits forming an ion channel. Activates upon binding of **two acetylcholine molecules** and will desensitize rapidly.
## Clinical pearls
**Curare**: Competitive antagonist for ACh. *Reversible*
**Alpha-bungarotoxin**: Competitive antagonist for ACh. *Irreversible*
**Myasthenia Gravis**: Autoimmune disease which targets ACh receptors, blocking them. Treated with Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor to increase ACh concentration in synapse.
# Calcium homeostasis
Calcium is bound through [[Signal Transduction Primer#Calcium signaling|calmodulin]], calcineurin, calreticulin, and synaptotagmin. It is sequestered (stored) in the [[Cells and Organelles Primer#Smooth ER|SER]] and the mitochondria. It is released from the cell using either a Ca2+ ATPase or a Na/Ca antiporter (3-to-1 exchange) on the cell membrane.

The SER will pump Ca2+ inside via Ca-ATPase. It has a ryanodine receptor (stimulated by caffeine) and IP3 receptor, both of which will promote the release of calcium into the cytoplasm. The [[Signal Transduction Primer#IP3 and DAG|IP3 receptor]] will bind IP3 from PLA2.

The mitochondria will store calcium using a Na/Ca antiporter, although this process is low affinity.
