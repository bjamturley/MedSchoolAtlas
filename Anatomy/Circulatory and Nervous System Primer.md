## Cardiovascular system

![[Heart flow diagram.png]]
### Blood vessels
Arteries
- Thick smooth muscle
- *Usually* high oxygen
- Arterioles deliver blood to capillaries

Types of arteries:
- **Large elastic (conducting) arteries**: Elastic layers which control pressure changes (e.g. aorta + primary branches, pulmonary trunk + branches)
- **Medium muscular arteries**: Circular smooth muscle allows for vasoconstriction. These regulate blood flow. These make up the majority of named arteries
- **Small arteries and arterioles**: Generally not named

Capillaries
- Form capillary beds
- Exchange oxygen, nutrients, fluids, waste products, etc.. with the extracellular fluid

Veins
- Venules drain capillaries
- Low oxygen
- Flexible walls

Types of veins:
- **Large veins**: The vena cava
- **Medium (superficial) veins**: Drain **venus plexuses** (e.g. cephalic and basilic veins)
- **Small veins**: Small veins combine to form **venous plexuses**
- **Venules**: drain into capillary beds

Telling arteries from veins: Arteries hold their shape, whereas veins flatten out and have wrinkly thin walls.

![[Artery vs. vein photo.png]]

Large arteries need elasticity in order to conform to pressure from heart. Medium muscular arteries allow for vasoconstriction/dilation to regular blood flow.
### Anastomoses
Connections between artery branches. Provide **collateral circulation** (alternate pathways) to regions/organs which prevents ischemia as other pathways will compensate. In some cases, may get **retrograde flow.** Common around joints.
### Vein concepts
From small veins you have drainage, or movement back to the heart. Most drainage veins have names.

In many cases, medium veins will diverge into two or more branches which accompany a deep artery (usually on either side). This is referred to as **venae comitantes**. The VC is wrapped in a fascia sheathe. Expansion of the arteries stretch and flatten the veins, acting as an **arteriovenous pump** which drives the blood back to the heart.

**Plexus**: Intricate network

### Telling arteries from veins and nerves
Arteries and veins share a fascial sheath. Nerves will originate from elsewhere

## Lymphatic system
Carries lymph from interstitial spaces to venous system, filtering the blood. Is a key part of the innate immune response.

**Lymphatic capillaries**: Points where fluid/particulates absorb
**Lymphatic vessels**: Carries lymph from capillaries to venous system
**Lymph nodes**: Masses of lymph. Lymph is filtered through these on its way to venous system
**Lymphocytes**: Immune (B and T) cells
**Lymphoid organs**: Produces, matures, or activates lymphocytes. (Thymus, red bone marrow, spleen, tonsils, lymph nodules)
### Leaky capillaries
The pressure in capillary beds is higher than in interstitium, which drives fluid into the latter. 3L per day.
### Lymphatic vessels
A single later of overlapping epithelial cells makes up lymphatic vessels. This allows for easy transference of debris/bacteria/etc. to lymphatic system. Drainage tends to flow in the direction of venous drainage. 

Right **lymphatic duct** drains the right upper limb / right side of head, neck, and thorax at **confluence of right internal jugular and right subclavian veins**. 

**Thoracic duct** drains into the rest of the body at the **confluence of let internal jugular and left subclavian vein.**

**Cisternal chyli** drains from the lower limbs, pelvis, and abdomen into thoracic duct
*"Chyle" comes from the high fat lymph in the intestines*

Basically, if its not draining into the top part of the body, it is for sure draining into the thoracic duct.

### Lymph nodes
Named for region, organ, or blood vessel.
Superficial (e.g. cutaneous) nodes often names for venous drainage. Lymphatic vessels deep in the gut (e.g. abdominal organs) are often named for the arteries there as they flow in the liver direction. 

You should be able to read the name and determine direction of movement.

#### Sentinel nodes
The first lymph node where cancer cells may spread into a tumor from an organ. Lymph is highly anastomotic (multiple directions the lymph can drain). When removing tumors, the lymph node is also sometimes removed from regions known to drain that organ. This can determine the presence or extent of metastasis depending on goals of surgery.
## Nervous system
Central â†’ Brain, spine
Peripheral â†’ Cranial, spinal â†’ ventral rami, dorsal rami
### Neuron anatomy
**Cell body** is where the nucleus resides. Many cell bodies together is a **ganglion in the PNS** and a **nucleus in the CNS**. **Dendrites**: Receive signal
**Axon**: Send signal

![[Neuron anatomy.png]]

### Nerves
Nerves reside in the horn roots ðŸ˜ˆ of gray matter. Rootlets emerge from horns.

**Sensory** neuron in **dorsal** horns. On-ramps.
**Motor** nuclei reside **ventral** horns. Off-ramps.

Rootlets emerge from horns and form dorsal/ventral roots. These combine to form spinal nerves which branch. Spinal nerves branch into rami, the dorsal ramus and ventral ramus. Because it is both dorsal and ventral, it has both motor and sensory info.

**Dorsal ramus**: Intrinsic muscles of back and skin of back
**Ventral ramus**: Everything else

The **dorsal root ganglion** is a good way of finding dorsal direction.

![[Nerve anatomy.png]]

### Spinal nerves
Named by vertebral region and the number in region.
Spinal cord ends at L1/L2. The **conus medularis** is the official end to the spinal cord. The **filum terminale** emerges from the tip of the conus medularis and continues as the **cauda equina**.

![[Vertebrae and nerves.png]]
![[Vertebrae and nerve legend.png]]

**Dermatomes**: Provide sensory innervation to the skin. Mostly ventral rami. These will follow the naming vertebrae of the spine.

![[Nerve innervation locations.png]]

### Autonomic nervous system
**Sympathetic**: Thoracolumbar (T1-L2)
**Parasympathetic**: Cranial nerves (III, VII, IX, X) & S2-4 spinal segments

1. Preganglionic cell
2. Autonomic ganglion
3. Post ganglionic cell
4. Post ganglionic neuron
5. Target

![[Pasted image 20230811144315.png]]
#### Sympathetic
Sensory signals can only be innervated in lateral horn of T1-L2. However, to get innervation elsewhere in the body, signals travel from the ventral (motor) root of the spinal nerve. This central spinal nerve connection is called the **white ramus communicans**.

**Paravertebral ganglia**: Sympathetic ganglion along spinal cord
**Prevertebral ganglia**: SNS ganglia located away from sympathetic chain ganglia at the anterior midline of the aorta

1. Lateral horn (T1-L2)
2. Ventral root (joins with Dorsal root) to form spinal nerve
5. White ramus communicans (myelinated)
6. Sympathetic chain options
	1. Synapse at same level
	2. Paravertebral ganglia: Ascend/synapse OR descend/synapse
		1. Gray ramus communicans (unmyelinated)
		2. Connect back to spinal nerve
		3. Ventral or dorsal ramus (depending on body location target)
	3. Leave chain without synapsing (**splanchnic nerve**) which will go on to synapse at prevertebral ganglia

Gray (off ramps) are all along the sympathetic trunk. **White (on ramps) only exist at T1-L2**.
*Gray all the way, white not quite*

For more on white and gray matter, see here: [[Neuroscience Concepts#White and gray matter]]
##### Sympathetic splanchnic nerves
- Greater (T5-T9)
- Lesser (T10-T11)
- Least (T12)
- Lumbar (L1-L2)
	- Exit in lumbar region
- Sacral (L1-L2)
	- Exit in sacral region

These will send signals to very specific innervation sites. The lesser splanchnic nerve also supplies the midgut.
##### Referred pain
Visceral (organ) pain neurons often wire together with sympathetic fibers. The neuron will send a signal along these routes rather than having its own pathway. Therefore, pain will be localized to the region (diffuse) as it activates the entire dermatome. Somatic pain (e.g. pinching the skin), is more specific.
### Parasympathetic
Preganglionic fibers in the PSNS are usually pretty long and synapse directly with the target organ.

**Preganglionic parasympathetic nerves:**
**Cranio**:  Nuclei of cranial nerves III, VII, IX, and X
**Sacral**: Lateral horns of S2-4 (travel along the pelvic spanchnics)

**Intermural ganglion** (usually rather short): In the walls of the target organ connect connect pre and postganglionic cells

**Peripheral parasympathetic ganglion** primarily targets the head.
