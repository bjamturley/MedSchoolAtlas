## What is
We are learning Gross Anatomy (macroanatomy). Microanatomy is histology.

**Regional anatomy:**
Each part of body studied separately, emphasis of relationships of structures in that region
## Terminology
**Gaster**: Stomach/belly
**Rectus**: Straight
**Femoral**: Thigh
**Vasa**: Vessel

Suffixes:
-**iod**: Like or resembles
-**ceps**, **capitis**: Head

**Eponym**: Structure names after a person
## Anatomical Position
Default is upright, face forward, limbs by side with palms forward

### Planes
**Median Plane**
Passes vertically through midlines of head/neck/trunk
![[Medial plane.png]]
**Sagittal Plane**
Pass vertically, parallel to median
![[Saggital plane.png]]
**Frontal (Coronal) Plane**
Pass vertically at right angles to median. Divides into anterior (front) and posterior (back)
![[Coronal plane.png]]
**Transverse Plane**
Pass horizontally. Divides into superior (upper) and inferior (lower).

## How to read axial / cross sectional image
Always as if **you** are looking at the patient.
Left side of image is patient's right side. Use the vertebral column to orient yourself.
## Terms of relationship
**Superior**: Higher then
**Inferior**: Lower than
**Anterior** (ventral): Closer to front than
**Posterior** (dorsal): Closer to back than
**Medial**: Closer to median plane
**Lateral**: Farther from medial plane

**Proximal**: Nearer to point of origin
**Distal**: Farther to point of origin
*Example*: Wrist is distal to elbow, elbow is proximal to wrist

**Superficial**: Closer to surface
**Deep**: Farther from surface

**Palmar**: Front of hand/foot (anterior)
**Dorsal**: Back of hand/foot (posterior)

*Digit 1 (thumb) is most lateral, digit 5 (pinky) is most medial.*
### Laterality
**Bilateral**: Both sides of body
**Unilateral**: One side of body
**Ipsilateral**: Found on same side of body to source of comparison
**Contralateral**: Found on opposite side of body to source of comparison
## Movement
**Flexion**: Movement of limb anteriorly (towards front)
**Extension**: Movement of limb posteriorly (towards back)

Flexion at trunk is bending forward, extension is bending backward. Lateral flexion is bending trunk to the left or right.

>**EXCEPTION**
At the knee joint, **flexion** moves the knee joint **posteriorly** and **extension** moves the knee joint **anteriorly**

**Abduction**: Movement away from midline ("abduct" is to take away)
**Adduction**: Movement toward midline ("add" back to body)

**Note**: Moving closer to a reference is adduction, farther is abduction
**Note**: The center point on the hand is the middle finger (3) and on the foot is the 2nd toe. Abduction would be movement away from this midline.

![[Shoulder and hip movement.png]]

**Medial (internal) rotation**: Turning lib inward
**Lateral (external) rotation**: Turning limb outward

![[Shoulder and knee rotation.png]]

**Pronation**: Internal rotation of the forearm
**Supination**: External rotation of forearm

>**MEMORY TIP**
*Thumbs up is rad(ius)*
*Supination can hold a bowl of soup*

![[Wrist rotation.png]]

**Dorsiflexion**: Movement of foot upward (dorsal fin)
**Plantarflexion**: Movement of foot downward (tippy toes)
![[Vertical foot movement.png]]

**Inversion**: Movement of foot inward
**Eversion**: Movement of foot outward
![[Lateral foot movement.png]]

## Musculoskeletal overview

**Axial skeleton**: Bones of head (skull), neck (hydroid, cervical vertebrae), trunk (rubs, sternum, vertebrae sacrum)
**Appendicular skeleton**: Bones of limbs, including pectoral and pelvic girdles

![[Axial and Appendicular Skeleton.png]]

### Upper limbs
**Shoulder** 
- Pectoral
- Scapular
- Deltoid

**The arm is the first segment if free upper limb**
- Anterior compartment
- Posterior compartment
- Centered around humerus

**The forearm is the elbow to wrist**
- Anterior and posterior compartments
- Compartments overlay the radius and ulna

**Hand is the distal segment of the upper limb**
- Carpals
- Metacarpals
- Phalanges

**Foot is the distal segment of the upper limb**
- Tarsals
- Metatarsals
- Phalanges
### Lower limbs
The gluteal region is the transitional region between the trunk and free lower limbs.

**Thigh (femoral region)**
- Anterior femur
- Posterior femur
- Medial femur

**Leg connects knee and ankle**
- Anterior tibia/fibula
- Posterior tibia/fibula
- Lateral tibia/fibula
## Osteology
**Body**: Principal mass
**Condyle**: Rounded (knuckle-like) articular (rubbing) area
**Epicondyle**: Superior/adjacent to condyle
**Crest**: Ridge of bone
**Facet** ("fuh-cet"): Smooth flat area covered in cartilage for articulation
**Foramen**: Opening or hole
**Fossa**: Shallow depression
**Notch**: Indentation
**Process**: Projection or outgrowth
**Tubercle**: Small rounded projection
**Trochanter** (SPECIFIC TO FEMUR): Projection of proximal femur
**Tuberosity**: Roughened elevation

## Join classification
Synovial joints (6 types): 
- **Ball and socket**: rounded heat to concave surface
- **Hinge joint**: Permits movement along one axis (uniaxial: permits flexion and extension)
- **Pivot joints**: Also permits movement along one axis (uniaxial: screw)
- **Plane**: Glides or slides across a surface. Some bones on hands and feet are like this (but don't rotate)
- **Saddle**: Concave + convex surface, permits movement along two axis
- **Condyloid**: Two flat surfaces, permits movement around two axes (think finger bend joint)

**Circumduction**: To move around in a circle. Condyloids and saddles can do this
## Skeletal muscles
Where muscles attach to bones
**Origin (proximal)**: Typically found along stationary bone
**Insertion (distal):** Typically found along mobile bone

If it crosses **posterior** to joint (e.g. elbow), you're going to get **extension**
## Fascia
Sheaths, sheets, or or dissectible connective tissue. Responsible for prevention of infection
**Superficial fascia:** Is *subcutaneous*
- Loose connective tissue
- Thickness varies

**Deep fascia:** Is *investing*
- Under superficial fascia
- Dense and organized
- No fat
- Will sometimes "dive" to deeper organs like muscles and neuro bundles
