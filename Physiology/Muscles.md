# Skeletal Muscle
## Structure
Fibers are composed of **myofibrils** and covered by a **sarcolemma**. The sarcolemma invaginates to create structures called **transverse tubules (t-tubules)**, which are grooves in the fibers that action potentials can reach into to innervate deeper tissue.

**Terminal cisternae** border t-tubules and contact the **sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)**. The SR, analogous to the [[Cells and Organelles Primer#Endoplasmic reticulum|endoplasmic reticulum (ER)]], will store calcium using calsequestrin.

**Triads** are a group of two terminal cisternae with a bisecting t-tubule. They are important for excitation-contraction coupling. Depolarization will move from *t-tubule → terminal cisternae → SR*.

## Action potential mechanism
The end plate will trigger an [[Ion channels and Action Potentials|action potential]] which spreads down the muscle fiber. This will proceed normally, with the one caveat that potassium cannot fully clear from t-tubules because of lack of space. With high potassium, repolarization is temporarily inhibited. The gradient is reestablished using chlorine channels which are always active.
### Clinical pearl: Muscle fatigue
Accumulation of extracellular potassium may be the cause of muscle fatigue. Preventing fatigue can be accomplished by boosting the chlorine leak channel, which can be achieved with lactic acid. **Myotonia** is a genetic disorder targeting this leak channel (downregulating them).
## Mechanical contraction
With depolarization, **L-type calcium channels** (DHP receptor channels) undergo a conformational change. L-type channels will activate **ryanodine receptor channels**, which allow calcium to be released from the SR into the sarcoplasm. Calcium activates troponin C, which leads to contraction.

*Depolarization → L-type calcium channels → ryanodine receptor channels → troponin C → contraction*
### Sliding filament structure
Myofibers contain sarcomeres, a single working muscle unit. These are composed of **actin (thin filament)** and **myosin (thick filament)**. When the muscle contracts, actin slides over myosin.

**A band**: Spans myosin, stays the same length when contracting
**I band**: Thin band containing actin and will stay the same length during contraction.
**H band**: Thick band containing only myosin and will shrink with contraction.

**Z line**: Attachment point for actin filaments. The area between Z lines is one sarcomere.
**M line**. Attachment point for myosin. The midpoint of the sarcomere.

## Sliding filament theory
**G-actin monomers** form an **F-actin filament**. Two F-actin filaments form a functional actin filament.

**Myosin doubles up on everything**
- Two heads: One binding ATP, one binding Actin
- Two chains of light meromyosin
- Two chains of heavy meromyosin
- Two hinged regions

When ATP binds, the hinged regions on myosin will bend 45-degrees, referred to as a **power stroke**.
## Filament binding regulation
**Tropomyosin** is found along the length of an actin filament. It must be moved to bind myosin.

**Troponin** contains three subunits
- **Troponin-T** (T for attach): Attaches troponin to tropomyosin
- **Troponin-I** (I for inhibit): Locks tropomyosin in place and inhibits myosin
- **Troponin-C** (C for calcium): Binds calcium, which moves tropomyosin and allows actin to bind myosin
## Cross-bridge cycle
1. ATP is bound to myosin, disconnecting it from actin
2. ATPase hydrolyzes ATP (→ ADP + pi), causing the head to hinge in place
3. Calcium binds Troponin-C, allowing myosin to attach to actin
4. ADP + pi is released, and the myosin heads bend 45 degrees (shortening the sarcomere by 1 micrometer)
5. ATP is added back to myosin, popping it off actin

The **velocity** of this cycle depends on the speed of ATPase, while the **tension** of the contraction depends on the number of cross-bridges formed and the concentration of ATP/calcium.
### Clinical pearl: Rigor mortis
When there is no remaining ATP (e.g., in a cadaver), the actin and myosin remain linked and the muscle remains contracted
## Isometric and Isotonic Mechanisms
**Isotonic contraction**: Muscle tension remains constant, but velocity changes (lifting a weight)
- **Concentric**: Muscles shortening (curling)
- **Eccentric**: Muscle lengthening (reaching)

**Isometric contraction**: Muscle length remains constant, but tension changes (pushing against a static object)

The **maximum velocity** occurs when the muscle is **under minimum load**. The **maximum tension** occurs when the muscle is at its **minimum length**.

Active tension: Driven by the metabolic movement of muscle
Passive tension: Driven by the inherent flexibility of the muscle fiber. Highest when compressed
## Getting swol
**Hypertrophy**: Increase in the number of sarcomeres and length of muscle fibers. The number of fibers does not change
**Hyperplasia**: Increase in the number of fibers (this does not occur with training, e.g. pathological)
## Regulation of muscle tension
A single action potential will create a **twitch** (contractile response). However, the series of elastic elements will put slack in tensons/tissue/fibers and prevent maximal contraction. Therefore, multiple action potentials will created multiple twitches, leading to a **tetany** or sustained, smooth contraction as all the slack is used up.

A **motor unit** consists of an alpha motor neuron attached to the muscle fibers it innervates. The **innervation ratio** is the muscle fiber / motor neuron ratio within the motor unit. A higher ratio is good for heavy tasks while a smaller ratio is good for precise tasks.

Amazingly, the brain will recruit the correct size motor unit for the task at hand.
### Motor unit types
|            | Type 1    | Type 2                   |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------------------ |
| *Color*    | Red       | White                    |
| *Fuel*     | Fat       | Glucose (to lactic acid) |
| *Aerobic?* | Yes       | No                       |
| *Speed*    | Slow      | Fast                     |
| *Fatigue*  | Less      | More                     |
| *Function* | Endurance | Power                    |
*NOTE: There is also Type 2a which has hybrid 1/2 properties*
# Smooth Muscle
The difference between smooth muscle and skeletal muscle is three fold:
- Thick filaments are thinner
- Thin filaments are attached to structures called dense bodies
- No sarcomeres (no muscle striation)

Also, it is controlled by the [[Autonomic Nervous System Effects Primer|autonomic nervous system]] whereas the skeletal muscle is controlled by the [[Neuroscience Concepts#Somatic nervous system|somatic nervous system]].
## Multiunit smooth muscle
Stimulation required from nerves for contraction (**neurogenic**). Used for fine motor controls, such as ciliary muscles and pili erector muscles for hair follicles. These cell membranes will be electrically isolated, with low density fibers.
## Unitary (visceral) smooth muscle
Can contract without neural stimulation (**myogenic**). However, can still be innervated by nerve input. Is used for synchronous contraction and will often be connected by gap junctions to share electrical potential. A group of cells connected by gap junctions is called a **syncytium**. 

Examples include the heart, GI, blood vessels, uterus, and bladder.
## Action potential behavior
There are three types of responses to an action potential in smooth muscle
- **Spike**: Large depolarization. Can be from electrical stimulation, hormone, or muscle stretch.
- **Plateau**: Delayed repolarization allowing for smoother contraction. See bladder, esophagus.
- **Slow waves**: Highly extended repolarization allowing for rhythmic movements as a result of slow closing of [[Ion channels and Action Potentials#Calcium regulation|voltage gated calcium channels]]. See stomach, intestines.

## Calcium transport
**Voltage (L-type) gate**: Located in caveoli and are triggered by an action potential
**[[Signal Transduction Primer#IP3 and DAG|IP3]] gate**: Open in response to hormones or neurotransmitters
**Calcium-induced calcium release channels**: Calcium release from SR
**Store-operated channels**: Calcium influx from extracellular space
## Contraction
Smooth muscle uses a **calmodulin-binding mode** similar to the cross-bridge system, without the troponin or tropomyosin regulation. The difference is that **calmodulin** is used to activate myosin via phosphorylation. Because calcium does not bind directly, smooth muscles are slower and less efficient.

1. Ca2+ binds calmodulin
2. Calmodulin binds myosin (light chain kinase), or MLCK
3. Myosin is phosphorylated by MLCK
4. Cross-bridge formed with actin
5. MLCK removed the phosphate, disconnecting the cross-bridge

Smooth muscle also has a **latch mode** of binding which allows it to maintain permanent contraction with minor energy expenditure. This is similar to the calmodulin mechanism, except after MLCK dephosphorylation of myosin a latch is formed with actin, locking it in place.
