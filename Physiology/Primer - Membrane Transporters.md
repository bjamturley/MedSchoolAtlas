# Properties of the cell membrane
Lipid soluble substances (O2, CO2, steroid hormones) dissolve in the lipid bilayer and will cross the cell membrane. Water soluble substances (Na+, Cl-, Glucose, H2O) cannot and require a transporter.

![[Primer - Lipids, Membranes, and Membrane Proteins#Membrane notes]]

**Integral proteins** span the entire cell and are embedded into the membrane. These are ion channels or transporters, for example.
**Peripheral proteins** are located on only one side of the membrane.
# Transport types
## Simple diffusion
Passive transport. A substance will move down its concentration gradient.
Depends on:
- Concentration gradient
- Permeability
- Surface area
## Carrier-mediated transport
**All** have:
- Chemical specificity / stereospecificity for the protein
- Competition for the protein
- Can saturate of the carrier
### Saturability
Carrier proteins have limited binding sites. The rate increases rapidly with increasing concentrations. At high concentrations, binding plateaus. This state is referred to as the **Transport Maximum (Tm)** or the maximum rate a substance can be reabsorbed.

Types of carrier protein transport
- **Uniport**: Transporting a single substance
- **Symport** (cotransport): Carrying two substances in same direction
- **Antiport** (countertransport or exchange): Transporting substances in opposite directions
### Facilitated diffusion
Transport of a substance **with concentration gradient**, but is **facilitated by a carrier protein**. Also a type of **passive transport.** Will be **faster than simple diffusion** because of the carrier. The rate of diffusion will also **reach saturation at higher concentrations**.

Examples:
- Glucose transport from intestinal epithelium/renal tubules to blood
- Transport of glucose to skeletal muscle/adipose cells (via GLUT-4)
- Transport of fructose in gut lumen to the blood

## Primary active transport
**Active** transport (requires ATP). Transports solutes **against** concentration gradient.
Carrier protein has ATPase activity.

Examples:
- Sodium-potassium ATPase (Na+/K+ pump)
- Calcium ATPase (Ca2+ pump)
- Hydrogen-potassium ATPase (H+/K+ pump)

The sodium pump exchanges 3 Na+ (going out) for 2 K+ (going in). This is an example of an antiporter
3 Na-Out / 2 K-In
## Secondary active transport
The solute is **coupled with sodium**, allowing it to be transported against the concentration gradient. Still **active transport** because the sodium is providing the potential energy as it moves along its own concentration gradient. Inhibiting the Na/K pump will stop this transport.

Example:
- Glucose transport in the gut: Sodium-glucose cotransport (SGLT)
# Osmosis

Movement of water across the cell membrane moves because of the difference of concentration of solutes.
