# Cell Cycle Phases
- **M Phase**: Cell splits
- **G1 Phase**: Preparing for DNA copy
- **S Phase**: DNA starts copying
- **G2 Phase**: Preparing to split
- **G0 Phase**: Resting, no replication
# Mechanism
DNA synthesis is catalyzed by a nucleophilic substitution reaction. The 3'-OH of the growing polynucleotide chain acts as the nucleophile that attacks the incoming [[Nucleotide Metabolism#Ribonucleotide Reductase (RNR)|deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP)]]. After breaking the alpha-beta phosphoanhydride bond, the dNTP is incorporated, base-paired to a corresponding nucleotide. 

The reaction is slightly exothermic, making it **irreversible** in vivo due to pyrophosphate hydrolysis.
## DNA Polymerases
- **Alpha**: Primase complex initiating Okazaki fragments
- **Delta/Epsilon**: Analogous to E. coli's DNA polymerase III holoenzyme
- **Beta**: Base excision repair
- **Gamma**: Replicates mitochondrial DNA
## Replisome Components
- **DNA helicase**: Unwinds the DNA
- **Primase**: Lays down RNA primers
- **DNA gyrase**: Resolves supercoils
# Initiation
1. **ORC**: A 6-protein complex binds at DNA starting points.
2. **Activation**: Proteins CDC6/CDC18 and CDT-1 bind to ORC.
3. **Helicase Binding**: These bindings allow another protein, MCM, to bind and unwind the DNA. Occurs in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.
# Replication
Bidirectional, initiated at the origin, creating two replication forks. Newly synthesized DNA remains hydrogen-bonded to the template strand, following the semi-conservative replication model. This allows for error correction if a mistake occurs in copying the parental strand.
## Leading Strand
DNA polymerase synthesizes new DNA in the 5' → 3' direction, maintaining continuous contact with the template, allowing for processivity.
## Lagging Strand
Synthesis occurs in the 5' → 3' direction but in segments called **Okazaki fragments**. Primase lays down an RNA primer, followed by extension by DNA polymerase.

RNA primers are removed by DNA polymerase I's 5' → 3' exonuclease activity, and Okazaki fragments are glued back together by **DNA ligase**.
# Fidelity Mechanisms
- **Base pairing geometry**: Correct nucleotide insertion is facilitated by low [[Enzyme Primer|Km]], while incorrect nucleotides exhibit a high [[Enzyme Primer|Km]].
- **Proofreading**: 3' → 5' exonuclease activity corrects erroneous insertions.
## Tautomeric States
Cytosine can exist in high-energy tautomeric forms that can mispair but revert to their normal forms, creating an opportunity for error correction.
