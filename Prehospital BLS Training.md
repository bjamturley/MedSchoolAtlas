# Step 1: Check pulse
Radial pulse felt on wrist, below thumb. Carotid pulse on neck. Average normal heart rate is 60 - 100 BPM.
# Heimlich maneuver
Pressure upward into thorax. If patient loses consciousness, lie them down and continue performing abdominal thrusts. For a toddler, use thrusts to loosen object and back blows over knee to expel it.
# Science of CPR
Hesitancy from bystanders to perform CPR is a major reason for a cardiac arrest fatality.
## Goals
- Perfuse the heart
- Perfuse the brain
- Minimize interruptions
    - Every time we stop CPR, the pressure in the chest significantly drops which is why continued compressions are important

Shooting for 100 - 120 compressions / minute
# Anaphylaxis
A life-threatening allergic reaction.
## Signs and symptoms
* Hives
* Itching
* Flushed skin
* Swelling
* Throat closing
* Constriction of airways
* Wheezing
* Trouble beathing
* Weak / rapid pulse
* Dizziness / fainting
* Nausea or vomiting
## Treatment
* Call 911
* Ask person for an Epi-Pen
## How to use Epi-Pen
1. Hold pen with orange tip pointing down (blue -> sky, orange -> thigh)
2. Remove blue safety cap
3. Press orange tip firmly into thigh
# Bleeding control
* A - Alert
	* Call 911
* B - Bleeding control
* C - Compression
	* Apply direct pressure to area
	* Torniquet 2 - 3 inches above bleeding area
	* Pack wound with gauze
		* Some gauze has hemostatic agents to promote clotting
	* Elevate extremity
# Seizure
Uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain. Most seizures last less than 60 seconds. 
* Help them to the ground. 
* Pad their head area. 
* People often vomit after a seizure so rolling them onto their side is good practice.
# Stroke
Loss of blood flow to brain. Could be a clot or plaque. Identifying for treatment very 
- B: Balance
	- Steadiness on feet
- E: Eyes
	- Loss of vision
- F: Face
	- Evenness
- A: Arms
	- Limpness
- S: Speech
	- Trouble speaking
- T: Time
	- Time to alert emergency response

# BLS CPR Incorrect Answers
- BVM provides 1 breath over 1 second, watching for chest rise
- For adults with breathing with a pulse, provide 1 breath every 6 seconds
- If the patient has a pulse but has inadequate breathing, deliver 1 breath every 6 seconds, or about 10 BPM
- A Bag-Mask device provides mechanical positive-pressure ventilation

## CPR For Children
See [[Pediatric BLS Algorithm.canvas|Pediatric BLS Algorithm]]

**Rate:** 100 to 120/min. For infants, find the brachial pulse on the inside of the upper arm (between elbow and shoulder). The femoral artery pulse is also available in the inner thigh, midway between the hip bone and the pubic bone.
**Depth**: Aprox. 2 inches for a child, 1.5 inches for an infant
**Hand Placement**: 1/2 hands on lower half of breastbone. For infants, can use two fingers below nipple line
**Chest recoil**: Allow complete recoil
