Epithelial cells are both effectors and inducers of immune response.
# Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissues (GALT)
**Crypt**: Place of epithelial stem cell proliferation and differentiation
## Epithelium
Contains the following:
**Enterocytes**: Have microvilli for nutrient acquisition
**Goblet cells**: Produce mucus, antimicrobial peptides and form top protective layer above epithelium 
**Paneth cells**: Secrete antimicrobial peptides. These reside in the crypt, keeping mucus sterile
**Enteroendocrine cells**: Produce serotonin (for peristalsis) and mediates immune regulation

Also includes **Intraepithelial Lymphocytes** and [[Immune Function Primer#Dendritic cells|Dendritic Cells]].
## Lamina Propria
Contains the following:
- CD4/CD8 T cells
- IgA/IgG Plasma cells
- Dendritic cells and macrophages
- Innate lymphoid cells (mostly ILC3)
## Peyer's Patches
These behave like lymph nodes. For more, see here: [[T Cell Mediated Immunity#Peyer's Patches]]

Contains the following:
- CD4/CD8 T cell
- B cells
- Dendritic cells and macrophages

Also contains **M cells**, which preferentially absorb antigens from lumen then transport them to dendritic cells and macrophages.
# Epithelium
Intraepithelial lymphocytes are immune cells in the epithelial layer. Lymphatic vessels collect materials that drain into the mesenteric lymph node. **Isolated lymphoid follicles** are tiny B cell follicles under epithelium.
## Protective mechanisms
**Mucus**: From goblet cells. Coat the epithelium to trap/eliminate microbes 
**Antimicrobial peptides**: Paneth and other epithelial cells use these to repel microbes 
**Low pH**: Makes it hard for microbes to survive (innate line of defense) 
**Lysozymes**: Degrade the bacterial cell wall (innate line of defense) 
**Microbiome**: Instigates development of **Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue** (MALT), produces antimicrobial peptides, and competes pathogens for nutrients 
**Inflammation**: Mucosal barrier breach recruitments of monocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils 
**IgA**: Highly present in the gut
# IgA
IgA is found in the gut as a dimer (bound to a J chain). The secretory component promotes **Polymeric Immunoglobulin (PIG)** to bind. PIG-IgA dimer travels across the epithelial cell and the J chain is cleaved, **releasing the IgA monomers** into the bowel lumen. Because the secretory component becomes cleaved, this is a **unidirectional travel**.

IgA will neutralize antigens and bind to bacterial surfaces, but will not activate [[Innate Immunity and the Complement System#Complement System|complement]].
## IgA utility
- Binds binds to toxins, viruses, and bacteria to neutralize them
- Prevents pathogens from binding to entering cells
- Carries pathogens back to the lumen via **transcytosis**
- IgA/Dectin-1 interactions on M cells promotes antigen-bound IgA presentation to a dendritic cell/macrophage
## Class switching
For more on class switching, see here: [[Humoral Immune Response#Class Switch Recombination]]

[[Inflammation and Repair#4. Tissue remodeling|Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)]] activate **TGF-beta**, which stimulates class switching to IgA in germinal centers. MMPs are found within eosinophil granules.
## Isoforms
There are two isoforms: **IgA1** and **IgA2**. **Secretory IgA** is abundant in the gut as a homodimer (IgA1-IgA1 or IgA2-IgA2) while **serum IgA** is found in much smaller amounts in circulation.
# Recognition of Pathogens in the Gut
There are a few ways this can happen.

- **M cells ingest antigen**s from the lumen and pass them off to dendritic cells.
- **IgG** binds to neonatal **Fc receptors (FcRn)** and enables the antigen to be **transported across the epithelium** for dendritic presentation
- Antigens inducing apoptosis **attract dendritic cells**.
- **Macrophages reach through lumen** to ingest lumen-dwelling antigens for immune response.
- **Goblet cells can ingest antigens** (in addition to mucus secretion).
- Dendritic cells travel back and forth between the epithelial layer and the lumen, capturing antigens.
# Activating Gut Immune Response
**Nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)** proteins exist in the cytoplasm and have the power to bind to bacterial cell walls. They activate the **[[Innate Immunity and the Complement System#Macrophages|NFkB]] pathway** which results in an inflammatory response (**IL-6, IL-1, TNF-a**). NODs also stimulate the **autophagic pathway**.

In addition, **cytoplasmic sensor molecules** can trigger the inflammasome pathway, leading to **caspase activation**.

These steps lead to ILC2 activation and promote TH2 responses (IgE switching, eosinophil activation, mucous secretion, and mast cell activation).
## Effector cell localization
Effector lymphocytes (B/T cells) returning to the same mucosal tissues they were activated in. This process is mediated by integrins (on effector cells) binding to receptors on the mucosal surfaces.
# Commensal Bacteria
Commensal bacteria primarily regulate the immune response.

**Bacterial flagella**
*IgA production → [[T Cell Mediated Immunity#CD4 Helper|Th17 cell differentiation]] → IL-17, IL-22 → mucus, epithelial repair, antimicrobial peptides*

**Butyrate (FA produced by some bacteria)**
*[[T Cell Mediated Immunity#CD4 Helper|FOXP3]] → TGF-beta, IL-10 → inhibits chronic inflammation*

**NOD ligands**
*Generate ILC’s and isolated lymphoid follicles*

**Epithelial cells**
*IL-33 for [[Hypersensitivity#Type II Hypersensitivity|Type II Immunity]] (worms and allergens)*
# Colitis Study
This experiment showed that T regulatory cells make TGF-beta that reduces the immune inflammatory response. Because chronic inflammation in response to intestinal microbes can be damaging, the immune system **balances this response with regulatory T regulatory cells** (e.g., TGF-beta) to limit inflammation.
