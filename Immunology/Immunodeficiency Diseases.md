An immunodeficiency condition results from one or more abnormalities of the immune system that manifest as an inability to fight off or recover from an infection.
# Functions of the Immune System
## Defense
Antimicrobial activity. If it’s working too effectively, we develop hypersensitivities aka allergies. When it’s not effective, we get immune deficiencies.
## Homeostasis
Removal of damaged and aging cells. If the body is too good at targeting its own cells, we get autoimmune disease.
## Surveillance
Removal of mutant cells. If this surveillance system malfunctions, we get cancer.
# Types of Immunodeficiencies
## Primary
Present at or around birth. Caused by defects in genes that control the expression of immune responses. Generally more rare than secondary immunodeficiencies.
## Secondary
Acquired as a result of some other issue, including infectious diseases, trauma, and exposure to certain drugs or noxious compounds such as radiation. Also can be acquired with age.
# Primary Immunodeficiencies
## Phagocytic cell deficiencies
In **quantitative defects**, levels of [[Innate Immunity and the Complement System#Macrophages|phagocytic]] cells are reduced, can be congenital or acquired. This increases susceptibility to infection. **Qualitative defects** are cases where phagocyte counts are fine but the cells are defective. This can cause to abnormal response to infection

*Examples of quantitative deficits*
- **Neutropenias**: Reduced numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) resulting from a genetic defect or an acquired deficiency.
- **Hyposplenism**: Reduced number of macrophages because of surgical splenectomy or hemolytic anemia (sickle cell).
### Leukocyte adhesion deficiencies (LAD)
Deficiency in adhesion molecules prevents macrophages from addressing infections. 

In **LAD1 I**, we see ulcerative lesions that have minimal inflammation and a lack of pus. Ulcers just get really scabbed over. In young children with LAD I, you will see delayed umbilical cord separation and periodontitis.

In **LAD II**, there is a deficiency in adhesins, preventing cells from leaving the vessels.
### Defects of granule formation and content
**Chediak-Higashi syndrome** is characterized by the fusion of multiple primary granules into giant granules and impaired lysosomal trafficking. T cell and B cell mediated immunity are functional but NK cells have lost their cytotoxicity. Patients present with partial albinism and recurrent bacterial infections.
### Defects of oxidative metabolism
A defect in the NADPH oxidase complex, meaning the macrophage can’t complete destruction of pathogens.

**Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD)** is characterized by chronic infection with [[Gram Positive Cocci#Catalase (+) Staphylococci|catalase positive]] bacteria. The most common etiology of CGD is an X-linked genetic mutation of NADPH oxidase; it can also be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Granulomas have an area of central necrosis just like those seen in TB, meaning they are caseating granulomas.
### IFN-gamma and IL-12 pathway defects
IL-12 is used to activate NK cells and TH1 cells to produce [[T Cell Mediated Immunity#CD4 Helper|IFN-gamma]] and IL-2. IFN-gamma will  trigger macrophages to further upregulate the inflammatory response. The issue arises with an autosomal recessive mutation in the IFN-gamma receptor.
## Complement deficiencies
Deficiencies in complement leave the body vulnerable to mostly bacterial, some viral infections.

**Early complement** component deficiencies like C3b increases susceptibility to [[Gram Positive Cocci|staph]] infections.
**Late component** deficiency (e.g. C5-C9) will increase susceptibility to Neisseria infections, as the [[Innate Immunity and the Complement System#Membrane attack complex (MAC)|MAC complex]] is what neutralizes those pathogens.
## Ab (B cell) deficiencies
When B cells have dysfunctional or deficient enzymes in their signal transduction pathways.
## Cell-mediated (T cell) deficiencies
**DiGeorge Syndrome** is the failure of the thymus to grow because of embryonic aortic arch defects, causing a congenital T cell defect. Patients are especially susceptible to viral and fungal infections. Presents with distinct facial features and cardiac defects.
## Combined B and T cell deficiencies
**Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID)**: Underlying defects are caused by failure of lymphocyte proliferation

*This can stem from various causes*
- A [[Immune Diversity and Recognition of Antigens#Clinical Pearl SCID|deficiency of proteins]] that make up receptors or associated signal transduction pathways
- Toxicity from chemical buildup in B and T lymphocytes
- Defects in the DNA repair pathways in B and T cells.

**Bubble Boy**: Male patient born with X-linked SCID. A blood test found that he had a deficiency in the gamma chain protein that makes up many IL receptors. He died of B-cell lymphoma after a bone marrow transplant.
# Diagnosis of Immunodeficiency
## Signs and symptoms
- Several ear, sinus, or deep-seated infections within a year
- Several pneumonias within a year
- No response to antibiotics or requirement for IV antibiotics
- Failure of infant to gain weight
- Persistent thrush in mouth/skin after 1 year
- Recurrent deep skin/organ abscesses
## Diagnosis
**TREC tests in newborns** are assays which reveal T cell receptor excision circles. These result from the modification of B and T cells for enhancing receptor diversity. No circle, poor diversity.
## Treatment
- Control of infections with antibiotics
- Administer IV, IM, or subcutaneous immunoglobulins
- Gene therapy with retroviral vectors has been used in the past, but isn't ready for primetime
