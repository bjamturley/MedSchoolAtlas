# Anatomical Barriers
These are colonized by natural microbiota. They take up space which could be occupied by invaders, secrete their own anti-microbial proteins, and stimulate natural antibodies. These organisms can cause problems in immunocompromised patients, if colonized in an abnormal location, or if stimulating an auto-immune reaction.
## Skin (epidermis)
Your meat suit. It also has **lamellar bodies** which secrete beta-defensin and calthelicidins (anti-microbial).
## Lungs (bronchial and respiratory epithelium)
Has a mucosal layer and ciliated cells. The mucus traps particulate matter/pathogens and the cilia helps moves the debis out via cough.

Patients with **cystic fibrosis** have thicker/dryer mucus making it more difficult to clear their lungs and making them more susceptible to infection.
## Gut epithelium
Had  mucosal layer and ciliated cells. Physically move out pathogens via peristalsis. **Paneth cells** release **alpha-defensin** (anti-microbial).
## Others: Eyes, Nose, Oral Cavity
# Anti-Microbial Proteins/Peptides
Assist by disrupting the membranes of pathogens.
## Lysozyme
Found in tears and saliva. Secreted by phagocytes and Paneth cells (in the gut). Targets gram (+) bacteria by [[Bacteriology Primer#Cell Wall|degrading peptidoglycan]]. Gram (-) bacteria has a secondary outer membrane protecting the peptidoglycan.

This exposes the lipid bilayer for **secretory phospholipase A2** to destroy the membrane.
## Defensin, calthecidins, lecticidens, histidins
Targets bacteria, fungi, and some viruses. Synthesized as pro-peptides which are cleaved to be activated. The mature form is **amphipathic** (negative and positive charges). It attaches to the microbial membrane to **form pores**.

Locations
- **Skin (lamellar bodies)**: Beta-defensin and calthelicidins
- **Gut (Paneth cells)**: Alpha-defensin, calthecidins, lecticidens
- **Oral cavity**: Histidins (specifically for fungi)
# Complement System
Found in the blood (humoral immunity) and responds to [[Immune Function Primer#Innate immunity|MAMPs]] on pathogens, either destroying the pathogen of recruiting/assisting other immune cells. Generally, when proteins are activated in this cascade, the cleaved (B form) binds while the original (A form) goes away.
## C3 Convertase
### Classical Pathway
In which the C1 binding complex binds pathogens with these features: **IgM/IgG antibodies (low affinity), c-reactive proteins, or MAMPs (like lipoteichoic acid)**. It has q, r, and s subunits.

1. C1Q initiates cascade: C1r → C1s→ C4 → C4b
2. C4b recruits C2
3. C1s cleaves C2 → C2a (serine protease) and C2b
4. C4b + C2a → C3 convertase
### Lectin Pathway
In which either **Mannose Binding Lectins (MBLs)** bind to **mannose** on microbial cell walls or **Ficolins** bind to **other carbohydrates**.

1. MASP1,2,3 (MBL-associated-serine-proteases) binds to MBL/Ficolins on the cell wall
2. MASP 1 → MASP 2 → C4 → C4b
3. Proceeds as the classical pathway
### Alternative Pathway
Makes an activated C3 convertase *before* binding to pathogens.

1. C3 spontaneously hydrolyzes and binds to Factor B
2. Factor B cleaves Factor D, forming C3 convertase
3. C3 convertase cleaves C3 → C3b (effector complement) and C3a (inflammation)

The C3b must bind to microbial surfaces immediately or else become inactivated.
## Outcomes
### Membrane attack complex (MAC)
1. C3 convertase + C3b → C5 convertase
2. C5 convertase cleaves C5 → C5b
3. C5b + C6-9 → MAC

MAC punches holes into sides of the cell membrane of microbes.
### Opsonization
Most important effect. Will **optimize phagocytosis**. Microbes covered in C3B are **more easily detected by phagocytes**. C3B is more efficient at killing pathogens than MAC, but it requires recruitment of additional cells.
### Inflammation
**C3a, C4a, and C5a** all increase inflammation. This improves **vascular permeability** and induces **Mast Cell degranulation** (releasing histamines and TNFa). As a systematic activation of this cascade can lead to anaphylactic shock, these subunits are called **anaphylatoxins**.
## Regulation
C1 inhibitor breaks up C1r/C1s (stopping classical pathway) and C3 convertase/MAC formation is inactivated. Pathogens can avoid the complement system by attracting Factor H/I (inactivators).
## Clinical pearls
The following are diseases resulting from deficits in each complement system component. These increases susceptibility to *Neisseria* and, in the case of C3, *S. pneumoniae*.
### C1, C2, C4 deficit (childhood)
Recurrent otitis and sinusitis. Systemic infection in 20% of individuals.
### C3 deficit (childhood)
Severe case presentation. Recurrent otitis and sinusitis. Severe systemic infection in 70% of individuals. Reinfection with same organism.
### MAC deficit (teens)
Increased susceptibility to *Neisseria meningitidis*. Reinfection with same organism.
### C1 inhibitor deficit (childhood-adolescence)
Antiedema without urticaria (swelling without redness) in response to trauma. Hereditary or acquired. Recurrent, asymmetric swelling of face, lips, or tongue.
# Innate Cellular Response
## Myeloid Lineage
### Macrophages
For more on macrophages in inflammation, see here: [[Inflammation and Repair#Macrophages]]

Phagocytose pathogens and kill them using **oxidative/respiratory bursts** using **NADPH oxidase**. An **NBT reduction test** can be used to test for activity of the respiratory burst.

They recognize microbes via **Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs)**. They bind to [[Immune Function Primer#Innate immunity|MAMPs/DAMPs]]. Cell surface TLRs recognize microbial cell wall features, while endosome TLRs recognize digested pathogen features. Basis for **adjuvant**.

*TLR + MAMP → degrade IkB → NFkB enters the nucleus → turns on pro-inflammatory/antiviral cytokine genes specific to the pathogen*

They will also secrete cytokines/chemokines to increase swelling and recruit helper cells.
- **IL1b**, **TNFa**, **IL6**: Vasodilation, swelling
- **IL6**: Stimulates liver to produce induced phase proteins. C-reactive protein (opsonization), [[Hemodynamics#Key modulators|fibrinogen]] (clotting), and MBL (complement system).
- **IL8**, **CXCL8**: Recruits neutrophils, basophils, T cells
- **IL12**: Activates NK cells and induces Th1 differentiation
- **GCSF**: Increases neutrophil production

Finally, in response to viruses, macrophages will also produce **interferons** which interfere with viral replication and infection, focuses the anti-viral attack for dendritic cells, macrophages, and NK cells.
#### Clinical pearl: Chronic granulomatous disease
**Deficiency in NADPH oxidase** means macrophages cannot kill pathogens. This results in **chronic infections and granulomas** which come from macrophages which have phagocytosed pathogens but cannot kill them.
## Neutrophils
Phagocytose and kill pathogens via respiratory bursts. Attracted to infection site via **chemokines (IL8)**. Can also degranulate and release pathogen-killing enzymes.
## Dendritic cells
See here: [[T Cell Mediated Immunity#Dendritic Cells (DCs)]]
## Eosinophils and Basophils
Kills parasites by recognizing **IgE, IgA, or IgG** and degranulating reactive oxygen species (ROSs). They also **increase collagen deposition** to form a granuloma around parasitic infection.

Involved in asthma, allergy, and [[hypersensitivity]].
## Mast cells
Release pre-formed and synthesized molecules to modulate inflammation like histamine and pro-inflammatory prostaglandins and leukotrienes for vasodilation. Activated by **C3b/IgE** but also **temperature** and **pressure**. This is why cold temperatures or pressure from eating food can cause a runny nose.

Involved in **Type 1 [[hypersensitivity]] (allergic) reactions**.
## Lymphoid lineage
Will parallel adaptive immune system cells, but lack clonal antigen receptors.
### Natural Killer (NK) T-Cells
Activated by **IL12** or cells covered in **IgG**. They will recognize the mack of MHC1 on cells, which are deactivated by virally infected cells to avoid cytotoxic T cells.

They secrete **perforin**/**granzyme** which form pores on the infected cells and **TRAIL complex** which activates caspase 8 in infected cells. Both these result in **apoptosis** of the target cell.
