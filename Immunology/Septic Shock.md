Shock is **inadequate cellular oxygen utilization** and is distinguished from hypotension. Signs and symptoms include **decreased mental status, cold and clammy skin, and decreased urine output**.
# Vocab
**Sepsis**: Maladaptive or dysregulated response to an infection and the presence of organ damage
**Septic shock**: Type of sepsis in which there is decreased cellular utilization of oxygen from circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities. E.g., sepsis with hypotension.
## Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS)
Diagnosis includes two or more of the following
- **High or low temperature**: Greater than 38 or less than 36 C
- **High heart rate**: Greater than 90 bpm
- **Tachypnea**: RR greater than 20 or hyperventilation PaCO2 less than 32 mmHg
- **High or low blood WBC**: Greater than 12k or less than 4k
# Epidemiology
Mortality rates
- **SIRS**: 7% 
- **Sepsis**: 25-30% 
- **Septic shock**: 40-70%
# Types of Shock
## Hypovolemic shock
Decreased blood flow to the heart and subsequent oxygen delivery to tissues due to volume loss. 

Compensation includes **increasing total peripheral resistance**.
## Cardiogenic shock
Failure of the heart leading to decreased cardiac output. 

Compensation includes **increasing total peripheral resistance**.
## Obstructive shock
Blockage of outflow from the heart leading to decreased cardiac output. Caused by pericardial tamponade, pulmonary embolism, or tension pneumothorax. 

Compensation includes **increasing total peripheral resistance**.
## Distributive shock
Severely decreased vascular resistance.

Compensation includes **increasing heart rate/contractility** to improve cardiac output.
# Inflammatory Response
Prolonged inflammation can lead to tissue damage and necrotic cell death. Dying cells release **DAMPs (damage-associated molecular patterns) that perpetuate pro-inflammatory activities**, creating a **positive feedback loop**.

This requires immunosuppression, which has the downside of making the patient more susceptible to the existing infection.
## Edema in sepsis
Activated neutrophils cause vasodilation and increase vascular permeability, leading to the flow of protein-rich fluid into the tissues.
# Therapeutic Approaches
Infection control is essential with broad spectrum IV antibiotics to start, followed by narrow spectrum antibiotics post-identification.
## Cardiovascular resuscitation protocol
Includes guidelines for administration of fluids, vasopressors, blood transfusions, and inotropic agents. This protocol decreased in-hospital mortality from 46.5% to 30.5%.
## Surviving sepsis framework
A side effect of pressors is vasoconstriction of arterioles in the extremities, leading to tissue hypoperfusion and necrosis. Use of vasopressors is emphasized, especially [[Adrenergics#Norepinephrine|norepinephrine]] which is a first line therapy.
