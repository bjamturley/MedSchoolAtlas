# Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)
Multi-system autoimmune disease with autoantibody production. 10x more common in women.
## Subtypes
### Acute Cutaneous Lupus (Malar Rash)
Rash across nose, sparing nostril divider. Rash may also be generalized on body and skin between joints of fingers.
### Chromic Cutaneous Lupus (Discoid)
High likelihood of scarring. These patients usually do not have systemic involvement.
### Neonatal Lupus
Passive transfer of SSA/B antibodies across placenta. Dermatologic effects will go away shortly after birth, while cardiovascular effects can be more serious.
## Key clinical features
**Dermatological**: UV sensitivity
**Oral**: Mouth ulcers
**Nephritis**: Major cause of morbidity
**Cardiovascular**: Lesions of valves, coronary artery disease, pericardial inflammation (serositis)
## Pathology
Interface dermatitis is the inflammation between the dermis and epidermis. Also exhibits "full house" immunofluorescence, in which all florescent stained proteins are positive.

**Leukopenia**: Low WBC
**Anemia**: Low RBC 
**Thrombocytopenia** 
**Low complement levels**
## Lab testing
Screening for Anti-Nuclear Antibodies (ANA) which is highly sensitive, but not very specific. Everyone with Lupus will be positive, but so will a bunch of people without.
## Mechanisms
An increase in apoptosis plus slow clearance results in **increased exposure to self-DNA** via increased neutrophil apoptosis, which could result in autoimmunity. Additionally, failure of [[Immune Diversity and Recognition of Antigens#Selection|negative selection]] could contribute.

A change in immune cell population could be a cause. This might stem from increased [[T Cell Mediated Immunity#CD4 Helper|TFH and Th17 and Th17]], or decreased Treg and CD8. This results in increased infections.

There is also a **cytokine profile unique** to lupus, in which there is a **high B cell activating factor**, increasing survival of B cell antibodies.
## Outcomes
The main mechanistic effect is that **high complement activation leads to complement protein depletion**.
# Sjogren's syndrome
Autoimmune disease primarily affecting the exocrine organs. 10-20x more common in women.
## Key clinical features
**Oral**: Defect in salivary glands leads to dry mouth, loss of pila on tongue, increased caries (tooth decay). Deficits in parotid glands leads to oral swelling.
**Eyes**: Defect in lacrimal glands leads to severe dry eyes.

10x higher risk of lymphoma development.
# Scleroderma
Fibrosis of multiple tissues (especially of the skin).
## Key clinical features
**Vascular**: Reynaudâ€™s syndrome (vasoconstriction of digital arteries from cold or stress)
**Nail beds**: Sporadic dilation of capillaries and telangiectasias (superficial blood vessels blanche with pressure)
**Fingertips**: Ischemia and ulceration due to thickening of media and intima layers of vessel
**Dermatologic**: Fibrosis or thickening of skin, giving a waxy appearance
**Pulmonary**: Fibrosis and honeycombing of lungs

Histologically, it presents increased fibrosis/collagen deposition of dermis.
## Mechanisms
*Key autoantibody targets*
- **SCL-70 (topoisomerase)**
- **Centromere**
- **RNA Pol III**
