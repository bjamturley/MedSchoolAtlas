# Tube-within-a-tube
[[Gastrulation and Embryonic Folding#1. Endoderm|Ingressing epiblast cells]] form a definitive endoderm. The barrier between hypoblasts and the cells of the true gut endoderm are a single cell layer which can be shown via fluorescent tagging of epiblast cells.

The tube-within-a-tube forms because the embryo and amniotic sac grow faster than the secondary yolk sac. The folding occurs cranially to caudally AND cross-sectionally **at the same time**.

## Blood supply to each section
**Foregut**: Celiac artery
**Midgut**: Superior mesenteric artery
**Hindgut**: Inferior mesenteric artery
# Formation of the stomach
Region of the foregut expands posteriorly around ==week 4==. At ==week 6==, the stomach then undergoes a **90deg clockwise rotation**. This rotation brings its ventral and dorsal mesenteries with it. The portion of mesentery attached to the *greater curve* of the stomach is called the **dorsal mesogastrium** and forms the **greater omentum**. The portion from the *lesser curve* of the stomach is called the **ventral mesogastrium** and forms the **lesser omentum**.

# Formation of the liver
This buds into the ventral mesentery ==week 4-5==, forming hepatic chords. The growth causes the ventral mesentery to be divided into two structures: the **lesser omentum** and the **falciform ligament**.

Out of the hepatic duct come the pancreatic bud and the gallbladder.

Vocab:
- **Falciform Ligament**: the part of the ventral mesentery connecting the liver to the anterior body wall 
- **Lesser Omentum**: the part of the ventral mesentery connecting the lesser curvature of the stomach to the liver 
- **Septum Transversum**: the membrane separating the thoracic and abdominal cavities which eventually becomes the diaphragm
# Formation of the pancreas
==Week 5-6==. The pancreas comes from the pancreatic bud formed with the creating of the hepatic duct (liver). It arises from the fusion of the dorsal bud and the ventral bud. Fusion occurs at the **same time as the clockwise rotation** of the other organs.

The **d**orsal bud then **d**isintegrates and the ventral bud becomes the main pancreatic duct.

With the pancreas, solid epithelial clusters form.

## Pancreatic cell types
**Acinar cells**: Secrete digestive enzymes (trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, lipase, amylase, (deoxy)ribonuclease, gelatinase, elastase)
**Ductal cells**: Line the pancreatic duct and enable enzymes to be secreted into the duodenum.
**Islet cells**: Endocrine cells
- Alpha: Glucagon
- Beta: Insulin
- Gamma
- Delta
- PP cells (lol)
## Clinical pearl: Gestational diabetes
Fetus is exposed to high glucose concentrations from the mother. This results in the overproduction of insulin by fetal pancreatic cells and results in **congenital hyperinsulinism**.

**Result**: Hyperplasia and damage to islet cells. Can cause infant diabetes and other pancreatic issues
# Formation of intestines
==Week 7==: The primary intestinal loop performs a 90deg rotation and herniates into the umbilicus. 
==Week 11==: The intestines have completed 270deg of rotation. The cecum now resides inferior to the liver.
==Week 12==: The cecum descends to its final position, forming the ascending colon.

If the vitelline duct does not retract you get **Meckel's Diverticulum**.

**Meckel's Diverticulum** **rule of 2s**:
- 2% of population
- 2% have symptoms
- 2x more common in males
- 2 feet proximal to terminal ileum
- 2 inches long
- 2 types of abnormal lining

# Mesenteries
Derived from the mesoderm which hold the organs of the endoderm in place within the body. The gut tube is incased in a mesentery (has a ventral and dorsal end) when the splanchnic mesoderm meet. The mesoderm will also form the peritoneal cavity which contains the various GI organs. 

**Dorsal mesentery** → *Greater omentum* 
**Ventral mesentery** → *Lesser omentum*

**Types**:
- Somatic
- Splanchnic
- Intermediate
