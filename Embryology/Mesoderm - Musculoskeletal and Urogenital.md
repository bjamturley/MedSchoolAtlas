# Embryonic Circulatory System
1. Blood (oxygenated) flows from the placenta to the umbilical vein
2. Blood enters the heart tube at the sinus venosus
3. Blood enters the atrium, mixing with deoxygenated blood from the common cardinal vein
4. AV-canal → Ventricle → Bulbus Cordis → Truncus Arteriosus
5. Blood flows through the pharyngeal/aortic arches and into the internal carotid artery towards the head/dorsal aorta
6. Blood diverts into the vitelline vessels/intersegmental vessels/iliac vessels
7. Blood returns to the heart via cardinal veins and the vitelline vein

When blood returns to the heart, much of it is shunted from the aorta to the umbilical artery (oxygenated in the placenta)

# Fetal Circulatory System
1. Placenta
2. Umbilical Vein
3. Ductus Venosus (Liver)
4. Inferior Vena Cava
5. Heart
6. Aorta
7. Umbilical arteries
8. Placenta

Blood flows into the right atrium of the heart via the ductus venosus (DV) and the IVC. Therefore, blood flowing into the RV is mixed. The blood flowing from the right atrium to the left atrium flows via the **foramen ovale**.

Some of the blood from the DV/IVC flows into the RV via the tricuspid valve. Most of the blood from the SVC flows into the RA and then to the RV via the tricuspid valve.

# Circulatory System Changes Post-Birth
**Ductus arteriosus** constricts, forming the ligamentum arteriosum.
**Umbilical vessels** constrict and degrade.
**Foramen ovale** closes, forming the fossa ovalis.
## Clinical pearl: Patent Ductus Arteriosus 
When the ductus arteriosus does not close and forms the ligamentum arteriosum after birth. This causes oxygenated blood to be diverted from the aorta to the pulmonary circulation via the pulmonary arteries. A large PDA will put strain on the lungs and could require intervention.

This is an acyanotic left to right shunt.
# Development of the Lymphatic System
Around ***6-weeks***, endothelial cells from the major veins undergo bilateral angiogenesis.

1. Right and left jugular veins form (draining lymph from upper limbs, trunk, head, and neck)
2. Retroperitoneal lymphatic sac forms
3. Cisterna chyli forms
4. Posterior lymphatic sac forms

At ***week 8-9***, the lymphatic sacs become ducts and the **cisterna chyli** become the **central lymph basin** which drains into the **thoracic duct** and empties into the venous circulation.
## Clinical pearls
### Turner Syndrome
Blockage of lymphatics leading to cystic hygromas which often go away with age.
### Milroy Disease
Inherited autosomal dominant disorder characterized by lower limb lymphedema (swelling caused by lymph accumulation). Will display as poor uptake of radioactive colloid in the lymph nodes caused by a lack of lymph vessels and abnormal function of the vessels in the legs.
# Arterial System
## Aortic arch arteries
Blood flows out of **truncus arteriosus** (becomes the aortic sac around ***day 24***) and into the **pharyngeal arch (aortic arch) arteries**. These become the arteries of the head and neck.

The **pharyngeal pouches** come from endoderm whereas the aortic arches each contain mesoderm and neural crest cells.

The left 4th pharyngeal arch gives rise to the aorta and the 3rd pharyngeal arch (right and left) gives rise to the common carotid arteries.

## Dorsal aortic region
Arises from the 4th pharyngeal arch and gives rise to the following subregions.

**Ventral vitelline vessels:** Supply the GI tract.
**Lateral branches:** Supply kidneys and gonads
**Dorsal intersegmental branches:** Supply the vertebral column, body wall, and limbs
## Umbilical vessels
Disappear after birth. There are two umbilical arteries. The arteries will carry deoxygenated blood away from the fetus to the placenta (to receive oxygenation).
# Venus System
**Vitelline region**: drains blood from the yolk sac and gut tube.
**Umbilical region**: One umbilical vein which carries oxygenated blood (from the placenta) to the fetus.
**Cardinal region**: Flows into the sinus venosus and develop the venae cavae.
# Arm Circulatory System
***Day 27***: Axial arteries develop via vasculogenesis from the **somatopleuric lateral plate mesoderm**.
***Day 30***: 7th cervical intersegmental arteries arise from the dorsal aorta and anastomose (connect) with the axial artery.

The axial artery will extend with the muscle progenitors and the ventral/dorsal muscle masses of the upper limb. Know the brachial artery of the upper arm and the interosseous artery of the lower arm.
# Leg Circulatory System
***Day 27***: Axial arteries develop via vasculogenesis from the **somatopleuric lateral plate mesoderm**.
***Day 30***: 5th lumbar intersegmental arteries arise from the dorsal aorta and anastomose with the axial artery.

The axial artery will extend and become the **external iliac arteries**. From the external iliac most arteries will develop except the **sciatic, popliteal, and fibular arteries.**
# Limb formation
Paraxial mesoderm forms somites, which are the source of muscles and vertebrae. By ***week 3***, there are 40 pairs of somites.

Functional parts of somites:
**Sclerotome**: Ventral and medial cells migrating towards the notochord produce vertebrae and ribs at each level.
**Dermatome**: Dorsal lateral cells migrate to form the dermis of the skin.
**Myotome**: The dorsal epimere forms the deep back muscles called the erector spinae while the ventral hypomere forms the skeletal muscles of the limbs/abdomen/thoracic wall.
## Limb buds
Form from the somatic lateral plate mesoderm while muscle progenitors migrate from the somitic myotome and then into the limb buds. Muscle progenitors form the ventral and dorsal muscle masses.

Mesoderm progenitors → Mono-nucleated myoblasts → multi-nucleated myotube
## Clinical pearls
### Muscular dystrophy (MD)
X-linked recessive disorder (more common in males). Caused by a defect in the DMD gene which produces Dystrophin.

**Dystrophin**: Links actin filaments to the extracellular matrix and is required for muscle cell interaction.

- **Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)**: Frame shift mutation causing proximal muscle weakness, also affecting the respiratory and and cardiac muscles.
- **Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD)**: In-frame mutation which causes partial loss of the Dystrophin protein. More mild phenotype.
# Bone development
Types of bone formation
- **Endochondral Ossification**: Cartilage model forms first, then gets ossified into bone. Bones of the axial skeleton including the vertebrae, ribs, sternum, cranial base, and limbs
- **Intramembranous Ossification**: Bone forms directly from mesenchyme or neural crest cells. Bones of the face and cranial vault
## Long bone formation (Endochondral Ossification)
**Epiphysis**: Compartment of cartilage growth from progenitor cells that consist of layers of **resting chondrocytes**
**Diaphysis**: Compartment of proliferating chondrocytes made of 3 layers
- Proliferating chondrocytes
- Pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes
- Hypertrophic chondrocytes (surrounded by calcified matrix)
### Formation steps
1. Vascularization of the hypertrophic region allows for invasion by osteoblasts. These secrete collagen to form primary spongiosa
2. Primary spongiosa becomes the primary ossification center, forming a trabecular network of bone
3. Grows as two epiphyses move in opposite directions by proliferating chondrocytes
4. Bone collar forms around diaphysis
5. Growth plates form at the base of the epiphysis and the proliferating chondrocytes of the diaphysis
## Neural crest cell bone formation (Intramembranous Ossification)
1. Mesenchyme condenses into sheets
2. Osteoblasts from vasculature become trapped in the sheet and secrete collagen
3. Mineralization from osteoblasts for trabeculae form spongy bone
4. Spongy bone is filled in by continuous mineralization forming compact bone
# Joint types
**Fibrous**: Mesenchyme between bones differentiate into dense fibrous tissue (e.g. Structure between cranial plates)
**Cartilaginous**: Mesenchyme differentiates into fibrous/cartilaginous tissue (e.g. Pubic symphysis, costochondral joints (sternum to rib connection))
**Synovial**: Mesenchyme peripheral to two bones condense into capsular and ligament tissue, then the central mesenchyme undergoes apoptosis leaving a fluid filled synovial region. A synovial membrane forms on the bone surfaces (e.g. knee joint)
# Rib cage development
***Week 5***: Costal processes (from **sclerotomes**) elongate along body wall
***Week 7***: First 7 ribs connect ventrally and cranially to mesenchymal condensates

The xiphoid process does not ossify until birth. The 5 ribs causal to the sternum (false ribs) do not fuse.
