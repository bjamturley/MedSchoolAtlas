# Key Structures
## Fungal cell wall
Great drug target as it's not in humans. The most important component are the **glucans** (50-60% cell wall). **Beta-1,3-D-glucan** especially is a site of action for Echinocandins.

**Beta-D Glucan Assay (Fungitel)** is a serum test to measure beta-D Glucan in cell wall. 

**BDG (+)**: Candida, Aspergillus, and Endemic Mycoses
**BGD (-)**: Cryptococcus, Mucormycosis
## Fungal plasma membrane
A bilayer composed of lipids and proteins. **Ergosterol** is the fungal analog of cholesterol. It is an important drug target for **Polyenes (Amphotericin B)** which increases the membrane permeability. Additionally, **Triazoles** inhibits ergosterol formation.
## Microtubules
Composed of tubulin and responsible for intracellular transport. **Griseofulvin** binds to microtubules, and inhibits mitosis in metaphase.
## TL;DR
**Polyenes**: Target membrane function
**Echinocandins/Pneumocandins**: Target cell wall synthesis
**Azoles**: Target Ergosterol synthesis
**Pyrimidine analogs**: Target nucleic acid synthesis
# Fungal Types
## Yeasts
Fungi that reproduce via **budding**.

*Examples*
- ***Candida Albicans***
- ***Cryptococcus Neoformans***
## Molds
Characterized by **hyphae** and grows via apical elongation. It is identified with Conidiophores and Sporangiophores.

*Examples*
- **Aspergillus**
- **Zygomyctes/Mucor**
## Dimorphic Fungi
Can exist as a yeast or mold form. Mold in the cold, yeast in the heat.

Examples
- *Blastomyces Dermatitidis*
- *Coccidioides immitis*
# Candida
A yeast. Can be germ tube (+) or germ tube (-). Every positive Candida culture is infectious, not an accidental contaminant, and must be dealt with swiftly.

It is an exception to mold/cold, yeast/heat. It forms germ tubes at 37 degrees as a mold. At around 20 degrees, it turns into a yeast displaying pseudohyphae.

# Mucormycosis
A mold. This review focuses on Rhizopus and Mucormycosis. Characterized by broad and ribbon-like, non-septate hyphae that branch irregularly and/or at right angles. 

The Rhizopus species can **thrive in high glucose and acidic environments** and it is **equipped with a ketone reductase**. Growth is favored in iron overload and the use of deferoxamine.
## Major risk factors

## Treatment
Surgical debridement followed by [[Antifungals#Azoles|Azoles]] and [[Antifungals#Amphotericin B|Amphotericin B]]
# Dermatophytes
A mold. Filamentous fungi responsible for cutaneous infection. Some types include Trichophton, Microsporum, and Epidermohyton.
## Clinical manifestations
All of the Tinea infections: Tinea pedis (athletes foot), Cruris, Manuum, Corporis (ringworm), Capitis, and Faciei.

They can also elicit an an immunologic response to fungal antigens. It occurs distal to the initial infection and manifests as **pruritic papulovesicular lesions**.
