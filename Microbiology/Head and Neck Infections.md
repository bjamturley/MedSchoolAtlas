# *Corynebacterium Diphtheriae*
Gram-positive bacillus which is unencapsulated, is non-spore forming, and nonmotile.

**Produce exotoxin when the patient has low iron** (turning on the TOX gene).
## Clinical features
Usually incubates for 2-5 days. Complications include respiratory and cardiovascular distress.

- **Pharyngitis**: Sore throat, fever, inflammation
- **White pseudomembrane formation** on proximal pharynx, which should not be removed for risk of hemorrhage
## Treatment
Diphtheria antitoxin plus antibiotics (especially erythromycin and penicillin). A Diphtheria vaccine also exists for the exotoxin.
# Streptococcus Pyrogenes
See here for more detail: [[Gram Positive Cocci#Group A *Streptococcus pyogenes*]]
## Clinical presentation
Usually incubates for 2-5 days. Complications include [[Gram Positive Cocci#Scarlet fever from *Streptococcus pharyngitis*|scarlet fever]] and associated [[Gram Positive Cocci#Scarlet fever from *Streptococcus pharyngitis*|acute rheumatic fever]].

- Sore throat, malaise, fever and headaches
- Physical exam will include redness, edema, and lymphoid hyperplasia of the posterior pharynx
## Treatment
Combo of [[Antibiotics#Amino-Penicillins|Amoxicillin]] and [[Antibiotics#Penicillins (PCNs)|Penicillin]]. [[Antibiotics#Clindamycin|Clindamycin]] if the patient is allergic to penicillin.
# Haemophilus Influenza
Gram-negative coccobacillus. It is finicky and requires a 35-37 degree C [[Bacteriology Primer#Chocolate Agar|chocolate agar]]. Other strains of Haemophilus can cause Otitis media (inflammation of the mucosal lining of the inner ear) and Community Acquired Pneumonia.

Main virulence factor is **polyribitol ribose phosphate (PRP)**.
## Clinical features
- **Epiglottitis**: Diagnosed via a “cherry-red” epiglottis
- **Meningitis**
- **Children will present with hyperextension of the neck, protrusion of the chin, and tripoding**
## Treatments
Usual suspects are [[Antibiotics#Cephalosporins|Ceftriaxone and Cefotaxime]]. If meningitis is included, steroids may help with hearing loss. For resistant strains, [[Antibiotics#Amoxicillin + Clavulanate (PO) (Augmentin)|Amoxicillin-clavulanate]] and [[Antibiotics#Fluoroquinolones|Fluoroquinolones]] are available.

Conjugate vaccine is available against the PRP capsule.
# Lemierre's Syndrome
This case specifically describes *fusobacerium necrophorum*, but the syndrome can appear with infectious mononucleosis, bacterial pharyngitis, or a dental abscess. Other implicated organisms include *S. pyrogenes*, *S. milleri*, *S. intermedius*, and *S. oralis*.

Complications include **thrombophlebitis in the jugular vein** and **pulmonary infiltrates**.
## Clinical features
- **Lingual vein filling defect** seen on an X-ray or MRI, which will present with **limited rightward rotation**.
- Painful cervical lymphadenopathy
- Moist mucous membranes
## Treatment
Three options: [[Antibiotics#Ampicillin + Sulbactam (IV) (Unasyn)|Ampicillin + Sulbactam]], [[Antibiotics#Piperacillin + Tazobactam (Zosyn)|Piperacillin + Tazobactam]], or [[Antibiotics#Carbapenems|Carbapenems]].
