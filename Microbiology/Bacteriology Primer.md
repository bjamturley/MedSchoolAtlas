Bacteria lack a nucleus, but contain a nucleoid (circular DNA). No organelles, so function carried out by plasma membrane. Bacteria which are **gram positive (+)** have a thick cell wall while those which are **gram negative (-)** have a thin cell wall.
# Components
## Capsule
Slime/glycocalyx external to cell wall. Present in both gram (+)/(-) bacteria. 

Some encapsulated bacteria can evade the [[Innate Immunity and the Complement System#Complement System|complement cascade]]:
**S**ome **K**illers **H**ave **P**retty **N**ice **C**apsules
- *Streptococcus pneumoniae*
- *Klebsiella pneumoniae*
- *Haemophilus influenzae*
- *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*
- *Neisseria meningitidis*
- *Cryptococcus neoformans*
## Cell Wall
Largely peptidoglycan and repeating N-acetylated muramic acid (NAM)/N-acetylated glucosamine (NAG). NAM/NAG will form cross bridges in gram (+) bacteria. Gram (-) bacteria have only partial cross links.

Antibiotics can target **tetrapeptides** (penicillin binding proteins) which are responsible for cross linking.
## Outer Membrane
Present only in gram (-) bacteria. The major component is **LPS/endotoxin**. Also contains pore proteins, as well as transport proteins for metabolites (maltose, vitamin B12, nucleosides, iron, etc.)
## Periplasmic space
Only in gram (-) bacteria. Contains binding proteins and plasma enzymes for **antimicrobial resistance**.

- **Beta-lactamase**: Breaks down beta-lactam rings of antibiotics
- **Aminoglycoside modifying enzymes**
## Inner Membrane
Proteins and phospholipids. In gram (+) bacteria, also contains **lipoteichoic acid**.
## Pili/fimbriae
Glycoproteins which adhere the bacteria to mucosal and epithelial surfaces. This is how E. coli adheres to the surface of the bladder and causes UTIs.
## Flagella
Predominantly in gram (-) bacteria. Responsible for motility. **Contains H antigen** which is unique to bacteria.
## Endospores
Only in gram (+) bacteria. Vegetative/resting state of a bacteria which allows it to survive harsh environments or stress. Contains genome/metabolic machinery and is heat stable. These spores can survive for years.

Types
- **Clostridia species (e.g., *C. diff*)**
- **Bacillus species (e.g., *Bacillus anthracis*)**
# LPS/Endotoxin
Will activate complement system, bringing neutrophils and histamine release (edema, hypotension). It can also cause interferon release and tissue necrosis. It is mitogenic for B lymphocytes. Contains three covalently linked regions.

- **Lipid A anchor**: Toxigenic
- **Core polysaccharide**
- **O antigen**: Immunogenic

Lipid A actives [[Innate Immunity and the Complement System#Macrophages|macrophages]] and upregulates production of cytokines (hypotension) and pyrogens (fever). Can result in circulatory collapse or [[Septic Shock]].

- *Neisseria meningitidis*: Exhibits meningitis (fatal), bacteremia
## Coccobacilli
Types
- *Haernophilus influcentae*: Exhibits sinusitis, bronchitis, otitis, meningitis, pneumonia
## Rods (bacilli)
Most common of gram (-) bacteria. These can either be slender *pseudomona aeruginosa* or fat and plump *enterobacterales*.

Types of *enterobacterales*
- *E. coli*
- *Klebsiella*
- *Enterobacter*
- *Citrobacter*
- *Proteus*

**Clinical syndromes**

# Bacterial Media
## Blood agar plate
For more, see here: [[Gram Positive Cocci#Laboratory Techniques]]

Non-selective for gram (+)/(-). Exhibits alpha, beta, and gamma hemolysis. 

**Alpha** will be greenish and test for *Streptococcus pneumoniae*.
**Beta** will be white and test for Group A strep (*Streptococcus pyogenes*). 
**Gamma** will have no hemolysis and test for *enterococci*.
