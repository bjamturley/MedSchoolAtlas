# Impetigo
*Staphylococcus aureus* or *Streptococcus Pyogenes*. Common in young children, tropical areas, crowded areas.

Presents superficially as [[Dermatology Exam#Blisters|vesicular-pustule]] lesions. The blister ruptures and creates a honey crust appearance.
## Treatment
Topical cream.
# Folliculitis
*Staphylococcus Aureus* or *Candida*. 

Inflammation and infection of hair follicles. Also **pseudomonas**, or hot tub folliculitis. They are **erythematous pustular lesions** appearing in clusters or **pyoderma localized to hair follicles**.
## Treatment
Generally benign.
# Furuncles and Carbuncles
*Staphylococcus Aureus* or *Mycobacterium fortuitum*. Typically found in areas of friction and perspiration and are associated with contact sports. Can become **Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)**.

**Furuncles** are coalescences of inflamed hair follicles, while **carbuncles** are collections of furuncles within subcutaneous tissue which drains the follicle.
## Treatment
TMP/SMX, clindamycin, doxycycline.
For hospital acquired MRSA: Linezolid, vancomycin
# Cellulitis and Erysipelas
*Staphylococcus aureus* or *Streptococcus Pyogenes*. Legs are the most common location. 

Patient presents with erythema (redness), edema, warmth, severe pain. **Erysipelas** is a superficial form of cellulitis presenting with an advancing border with clear demarcation.
## Treatment
...
# Toxin Mediated Syndromes
*Staphylococcus Aureus*
## Food poisoning
**Enterotoxin A-F**.

Nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhea.
## Scalded skin syndrome
**Exfoliative toxin**. Typically infants.

Peri-oral erythema (redness), exfoliative bullous dermatitis, Nikolyskyâ€™s sign.
## Toxic shock syndrome
TSST-1, enterotoxin A/B (superantigens). Most common in **menstruating females through tampon use** and **post-operation patients**.

Fever, rash, desquamation, hypotension with poor peripheral perfusion, conjunctival suffusion.
**Treatment**: Clindamycin (decreases toxic protein production), nafcillin, vancomycin
# Necrotizing Fasciitis
Related to M1 and M3 proteins of *Streptococcus Pyogenes*.

**Type I**: Polymicrobial
**Type II**: Monomicrobial

Causes deep tissue infection, bacteremia, and multiorgan failure with high mortality.
## Treatment
Surgery, PCN with clindamycin, IV immunoglobulins.
# Fournier's Gangrene
Synergistic polymicrobial infection. Anaerobes, Enterobacteriaceae, [[Gram Positive Cocci]]. Common in diabetic or obese patients.

Rapidly spreading infection of skin and soft tissues of the male GU tract.
## Treatment
Surgery.
# Clostridia Myonecrosis (Gas Gangrene)
*Clostridia perfringens* alpha toxin. Found in GI or trauma surgery because Clostridia in the gut can colonize the surgical site.

Spreads rapidly to muscle and soft tissues. Local pain, edema, pallor, bullous lesions, tachycardia, hypertension, AKI, hemolysis.
## Treatment
Surgery, penicillin, clindamycin (turns off alpha toxin production).
# Unusual Pathogens
## Pseudomonas Aeruginosa
*Ecthyma gangrenosum*
See here: [[Hospital Acquired Infections#Pseudomonas Aeruginosa]]
## Tattoo ink and water contaminate
*Mycobacterium chelonae*
## Furuncles common from nail salons
*Mycobacterium fortuitum*
## Seafood and seawater injury pathogen
*Vibrio Vulnificus*. 

Those with any type of liver disease are more at risk. See here: [[Enterics#V. vulnificus]]
