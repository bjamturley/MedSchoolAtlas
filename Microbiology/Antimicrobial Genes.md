Inappropriate prescribing predisposes patients to Clostridioides difficile.
# Resistance Mechanisms
There are four types
- Enzymatic alteration/deactivation of the antibiotic
- Alteration of the antibiotic binding site
- Alteration/closure of antibiotic entry sites
- Antibiotic drug efflux pump
## Beta-lactamases
Enzymes that disrupt the beta-lactam ring produced by some gram-negative bacteria. This occurs via hydrolysis.

**TEM-1/2** are plasmid mediated β-lactamases. They can be found in the following organisms:
- [[Enterics|Enterobacteriaceae]]
- [[Healthcare Acquired Infections#*Pseudomonas Aeruginosa*|Pseudomonas]]
- *Haemophilus influenzae*
- *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*

They are active against PCNs and Cefazolin, primarily **breaking down first generation cephalosporins and all the penicillins**. 
### Treating for beta-lactamase resistance
Beta-lactamases are not active against cephalosporins with **an oxyimino side chain**. Also consider **Amoxicillin-Clavulanate**. Clavulanate serves as a suicide molecule and binds to the beta-Lactamase preventing it from reaching amoxicillin.

Some organisms have **Extended Spectrum beta-Lactamases (ESBL)** via the **CTX-M gene**, which confers resistance to the oxyimino side chain as well. If there is **resistance to Ceftriaxone, assume it is an ESBL organism**.

**ESBL organisms seen in hospitals**
- *Klebsiella pneumoniae*
- *Klebsiella oxytoca*
- *Escherichia coli*

**ESBLs are still susceptible to cephamycins** (cefoxitin and cefotetan).
# Carbapenem Resistant Enterobacterales (CRE)
Resistance to at least one carbapenem or the presence of a carbapenemase. They tend to have several different resistance mechanisms.

**Carbapenemase** can break down the beta-lactam ring of a carbapenem. These organisms can also exhibit alterations in the outer membrane proteins, preventing attachment of antibiotics. Alterations in the Porin channels prevents the antibiotic from diffusing into membrane.
## Carbapenemases
50% of all CRE infections in the United States are due to carbapenemases.

**Important types**
- *Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPC)*
- *New Delhi metallo-β-lactamases (NDMs)*
## MecA gene
Encodes for a low affinity penicillin binding protein 2A (**PBP2A**). Beta-lactam antibiotics are unable to bind to the altered PBP2A.

The mecA gene is carried in the **Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome (SCC mec)** and gets incorporated into the bacterial host's genome.

SCC can also carry mecC, which is bovine, but can be responsible for MRSA.
## Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
This confers resistance to all beta-lactams.

**Hospital acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA)**: Multidrug resistant (type I-3, 6, 8)
**Community acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA)**: Confers only beta-lactam resistance (type 4, 5, 7)
# blaZ gene
Stands for beta-Lactamase Z. It encodes for Penicillinase production within *Staphylococcus aureus*.
