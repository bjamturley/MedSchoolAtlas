# Pseudomonas Aeruginosa
Obligate aerobe. Appears as smooth round colonies with **green-blue coloration**. Oxidase positive. Antibiotics can alter the microbiome and allow *P. Aeruginosa* to colonize opportunistically.

Is generally present in water and is common in hospital-acquired infections. They are especially common in devices which disrupt host barriers, like ventilators or catheters. They are treated with **higher doses of antibiotics as it has several virulence factors**.
## Virulence factors
- **Pili and flagella**: Attachment to host cells
- **Secretion systems**: Inflammation and tissue injury
- **Endotoxin (LPS)**: Resists innate host defenses
- **Pyocyanin (pigment toxin)**: Tissue damage
- **Quorum-sensing molecules**: Facilitate cell-to-cell communication
## Symptoms
- Bacteremia
- Infective endocarditis
- Pneumonia
- Bone and joint infections
- [[Skin and soft tissue infections]] (e.g., swimmers ear, malignant otitis externa)
- Eye infections (keratitis, endophthalmitis)
## Antibiotics resistance
### Intrinsic resistance
- Decreased permeability of the membrane
- Efflux pumps
- Anti-microbial-modifying enzymes
### Acquired resistance
Can be **transmitted through mobile genetic elements** (plasmids, transposons, integrins) which carry **extended-spectrum beta-lactamases**, **carbapenemases**, and **aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes**.

Mutations can lead to **multiple drug efflux pumps** and **downregulation of outer membrane protein**, OprD, which is a carbapenem-specific porin.
# Acinetobacter baumanii
Aerobic, non-motile, catalase-positive, oxidase-negative, gram-negative coccobacillus.

*Pro tip: "cine" means motion. Therefore "acine" means no motion.*

Naturally inhabit water an soil and can survive in iron limited host environments. They can form biofilms on **mucosal surfaces and medical devices**.
## Antibiotics resistance
In addition to below, can also acquire foreign genetic material to enhance survival and increase resistance to antimicrobial agents.
### Intrinsic resistance
- Decreased permeability of the membrane
- Efflux pumps
- Anti-microbial-modifying enzymes
### Acquired resistance
Can be **transmitted through mobile genetic elements** (plasmids, transposons, integrins) which carry **extended-spectrum beta-lactamases**, **carbapenemases**, and **aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes**.

Mutations can lead to **multiple drug efflux pumps** and **downregulation of outer membrane protein**, OprD, which is a carbapenem-specific porin.
# Stenotrophomonas maltophilia
Aerobe, oxidase-negative, catalase-positive, gram-negative, bacillus
## Antibiotic resistance
Inherent resistance to most beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and various disinfectants. For this reason, it is hard to know the best antibiotic to use. [[Antibiotics#Sulfamethoxazole + Trimethoprim (SMX-TMP)|Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SMX-TMP)]] is generally the drug of choice here.
# Burkholderia cepacia complex
This is a bunch of distinct species which look similar. They can bind various epithelial cell receptors.

*B. cenocepacia* and *B. multivorans* are the most common species. Risk factor for cystic fibrosis.
