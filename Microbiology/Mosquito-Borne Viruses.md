4 out of 5 diseases transmit through ***Aedes Aegypti* mosquitos**, which are native to Africa.
Yellow Fever transmits through both ***Aedes Aegypti*** and ***Haemagogus spp.***, native to the Americas.
West Nile Virus transmits through ***Culex spp.***

Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya cause very similar symptoms. Often **cannot distinguish them without PCR or Serology**.

Additionally, they have a short incubation period and acute phase of illness: **On in a week, gone in a week**.
# Symptom Profiles
|                | Zika | Dengue | Chikungunya |
| -------------- | ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| *Fever*          | +    | +++    | +++         |
| *Rash*           | +++  | +      | ++          |
| *Conjunctivitis* | ++   | -      | -           |
| *Arthralgia*     | ++   | -      | +++         |
| *Myalgia*        | +    | ++     | +           |
| *Headache*       | +    | ++     | ++          | 
# Dengue
Flavivirus. 

Severe Myalgias gives Dengue the name “breakbone fever.” Additionally, the headache is generally retroorbital (behind the eyes).
## Progression
**Febrile Period (1-3 days)**: Normal fever, headache, myalgia, rash
**Critical Period (3-5 days)**: Hematocrit increases, platelet count decreases. Abdominal pain, vomiting, hepatomegaly.
**Severe Period (5+ days)**: Shock, Bleeding, 3rd spacing (edema of interstitium), organ dysfunction
## Diagnosis
PCR if presenting within 1st week. Otherwise, IgG/IgM serology is required.
## Treatment
Acetaminophen as [[NSAIDs]] will result in uncontrolled bleeding.

There is a **vaccine available for teenagers with prior history of infection**.
# Chikungunya
Alphavirus.

The most severe symptom is **arthralgia and arthritis**.
## Diagnosis
PCR if presenting within 1st week. Otherwise, IgG/IgM serology is required
## Treatment
Use NSAIDs if certain it is not Dengue. Otherwise, treat with acetaminophen.
# Zika
Flavivirus.

**The key symptom is conjunctivitis which is unique to Zika**. Also important to note is that **Zika can be sexually transmitted**.

**Congenital Zika Syndrome**: Microcephaly and neurological developmental issues.
## Diagnosis
PCR if presenting within 2 weeks. Otherwise, only IgM serology is available.
# Yellow Fever
Incubates for 3-5 days.

**Sylvatic transmission** cycles between humans, mosquitos, and monkeys, while **urban transmission** cycles between only humans and mosquitos.
## Progression
Febrile phase: Fever, Headache, Myalgia (similar to above two)
**Intoxication phase**: Seizures, renal failure, Hemorrhage, **Acute hepatocellular necrosis**
## Treatment
Prevention only. There is **a live, attenuated vaccine available**.
# West Nile
Flavivirus. Has a transmission cycle between birds, mosquitos, and humans.

Symptoms include fever, malaise, and rash. In rare cases, it can progress to a neuro-invasive disease which can result in acute ascending flaccid paralysis and aseptic meningitis.
## Treatment
Prevention only. No vaccine either.
