Specifically, Human Parvovirus B19. Small, non-enveloped negative strand DNA virus similar to [[Adenovirus]]. 

Has an incubation period of 4-14 days. Prolonged shedding is possible in immunocompromised patients. After the formation of antigen-antibody immune complexes, hosts are no longer infectious.
# Cellular Targets
Transmitted through contact with **respiratory droplets**, **transfusions with infected blood**, or **from mother to fetus** during pregnancy. The virus targets **erythroid precursor cells** leading to **inhibition of erythrocyte production**, destruction of reticulocytes, and erythrolysis.
# Clinical Features
Five distinct syndromes. Most cases will experience mild flu-like symptoms (fever, malaise, myalgia) or be completely asymptomatic.
## Erythema Infectiosum (Fifth Disease)
Common childhood exanthem (skin rash associated with systemic infection). The classic presentation is described as a "slapped cheek" rash across the face. It's a shame this looks so cute.

## Arthritis (Polyarthropathy Syndrome)
Inflammation of the joints due to direct infection or formation of antigen-antibody immune complexes. This is **non-erosive**, so joint cartilage and architecture are not destroyed. More common in females.
## Transient Aplastic Anemia
Self-limited anemia that typically resolves within 1-2 weeks. Seen in individuals with **pre-existing hematologic disease** (e.g., sickle cell anemia, iron-deficiency anemia, spherocytosis). Symptoms include **severe anemia and lethargy**.
## Pure Red Cell Aplasia
Immunocompromised patients **cannot clear the virus from the body**. This leads to persistent infection attacking red blood cells, resulting in **chronic anemia**.
## Fetal Infection
- **Severe anemia**: Hypoxia and heart failure
- **Hydrops fetalis**: Non-immune disease that can develop secondary to infection and anemia. Presents with **anasarca (generalized edema)**.
# Diagnosis
Made clinically without serologic testing, especially if the patient displays classic presentation of the malar rash.
# Management
The majority of cases are self-limited. Treatment is generally supportive.

More severe cases involving aplastic anemia may require blood transfusions or stem cell transplant.
