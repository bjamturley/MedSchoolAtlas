Double-stranded DNA, capsid, and tegument encased in a glycoprotein/lipid bilayer envelope.
# Alpha Herpes
HSV-1 and HSV-2. Transmitted through direct contact with **contaminated saliva or genital fluids**. Targets **epithelial cells**.

Replicates inside the host cell nucleus. Encoded by **thymidine kinase and DNA polymerase** that are key targets for medication.
## Treatment
Only indicated in cases of encephalitis, neonatal infection, or genital disease.
### Nucleoside analogs
Inhibit active DNA polymerase of the virus. Toxicity includes renal (crystals in renal tubules), CNS (hallucinations, lethargy), and transaminitis elevation in liver function tests).

*Drugs*
- **Acyclovir**: Guanosine (purine) analog phosphorylated by Herpes virus-encoded thymidine kinase to stop DNA Polymerase. Absensce of viral thymidine kinase leads to resistance to Acyclovir.
- **Cidofovir**: Does not require phosphorylation to become activated and so can be used in cases of acyclovir resistance.

*Note: Acyclovir can be used for prophylaxis to decrease risk for partner transmission*
### Other medications
Non-nucleoside/nucleotide inhibition of DNA polymerase. Toxicity includes CNS, GI, and can cause cytopenias (lower blood cell counts).

*Drugs*
- **Foscarnet**: Does not require phosphorylation to become activated and so can be used in cases of acyclovir resistance.
# HSV-1
Alpha Herpes.
## Skin and mucocutaneous
- **Gingivostomatitis**: Fever, sore throat, pharyngeal erythema and vesicular lesions of the mouth. Found in children.
- **Herpes Labialis (cold sores)**: Vesicles at mucocutaneous junctions of the lips or nose. 
- **Herpes whitlow**: Lesions of the finger or hand from autoinoculation (e.g., mouth to hand).
- **Herpes gladiatorum**: Vesicular lesions in the areas of exposure. Found among wrestlers or individuals in close contact.
- **Eczema Herpeticum (Kaposiâ€™s varicelliform eruption)**: Vesicular lesions at sites of atopic dermatitis/eczema.
- **Keratoconjunctivitis**: Corneal ulcers and conjunctival epithelial lesions.
## Visceral
- **Disseminated Disease**: Esophagitis/pneumonitis. Found in immunocompromised hosts.
- **Encephalitis**: Fever, headache, vomiting, seizures, altered mental status. Can see necrosis of temporal lobe. Occurs with primary or recurrent infection and has high mortality and neurologic sequelae.
# HSV-2
Alpha Herpes.
## Genital
Vesicular lesion, can be accompanied by fever and inguinal lymphadenopathy. 60% recurrence rate.
## Neonatal
Transmitted via exposure to vesicles in birth canal during delivery

**Type 1**: Skin, eye, and mouth (see HSV-1 Skin and mucocutaneous)
**Type 2**: Encephalitis (see HSV-1 Visceral)
**Type 3**: Disseminated infection (see HSV-1 Visceral)
# Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV)
Transmitted via respiratory droplets or direct contact with lesions. Targets epithelial cells.
## Pathogenesis
Entry via **upper respiratory tract** and affects sensory neurons which carry them to the flow to the **dorsal root ganglia**. **Latent virus is maintained in the nucleus** but does not integrate host DNA. **Can reactivate in immunodepressed states**.
## Clinical features
Painful **papulovesicular rash** of the extremities/head, fever, malaise, loss of appetite, headache.

*Complications*
- Pneumonia
- Encephalitis
- Hepatitis (associated with Reye's Syndrome)
- Secondary bacterial skin infections from scratching lesions (e.g., [[Gram Positive Cocci#Group A *Streptococcus pyogenes*|GAS]])
## Treatment
Antiviral therapy with **acyclovir**. Prevention includes **varicella immunoglobulin** after exposure especially for at risk individuals. There is also a **live-attenuated vaccine** available.
# Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
Transmitted via transplacental, breast milk, saliva, sexual contact, blood transfusions and organ transplantation. Targets bone marrow and lymphocytes.
## Clinical features
- **Congenital CMV**: [[Ectoderm - Neurulation#Microcephaly|Microcephaly]], "blueberry muffin" rash, growth retardation, hepatosplenomegaly, seizures, retinitis
- **Primary infection**: Can cause heterophile-negative mononucleosis (fever, sore throat, fatigue)
- **Reactivation**: Pneumonitis, esophagitis, colitis hepatitis, retinitis in immunocompromised individuals.
## Treatment
**For congenital infections and reactivation**: Ganciclovir, valganciclovir
**For resistance to Ganciclovir**: Foscarnet, cidofovir, leflunomide

**For transplant recipients**: Acyclovir as a prophylaxis
# Ebstein-Barr Virus (EBV)
Viral capsid antigen. Transmitted via saliva. Targets lymphocytes.
## Clinical features
- **Infectious mononucleosis**: Fever, lymphadenopathy, sore throat, splenomegaly.
- **Oral hairy leukoplakia**: White lesions or patches on later border of the tongue. Seen in AIDS patients.
## Treatment
Not required unless immunocompromised. Decrease immunosuppression in these cases. May consider **rituximab** (CD20 monoclonal antibody) or **valganciclovir**.
# Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6)
Transmitted via saliva. Targets lymphocytes and monocytes.
## Clinical features
- **Children**: Fever with rash
- **Adults**: Mononucleosis-type syndrome (fever, adenopathy, encephalitis)
- **Reactivation**: Meningoencephalitis, myocarditis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, bone marrow failure
## Treatment
Antiviral treatment if immunocompromised. Consider **ganciclovir**.
# Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8)
AKA: Kaposi Sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Transmitted via contact with contaminated saliva or genital fluids. Targets vascular endothelial cells.

Affects cell cycle regulation and can lead to cellular proliferation and cancer.
## Clinical features
- Children: Fever and maculopapular rash
- Adults: Immunocompromised individuals can present with adenopathy, rash, and GI symptoms
### Kaposi Sarcoma
Vascular tumor that develops with impaired [[T Cell Mediated Immunity#CD8 Cytotoxic (Killer)|CD8]] response. It has indolent, cutaneous proliferation in the lower extremities. 
## Treatment
Direct antiviral therapy: Ganciclovir, cidofovir, foscarnet, adefovirand acyclovir.

May also include chemotherapy for HHV-8 associated malignancies.
