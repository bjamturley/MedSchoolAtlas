RNA viruses that require host cells and host machinery for replication and propagation.
# Human T-Lymphotropic Virus (HTLV)
Can be transmitted by sexual contact, breast feeding, blood transfusion, or bites from infected primates.

Both HTLV-1 and 2 can cause **HTLV associated myelopathy (HAM) and tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP)**. **Only HTLV-1 can cause acute T-cell leukemia/lymphoma**.
## Pathology
**Cell proliferation**: Activation of oncogenes **fos** and **erb** as well as **IL-2**
**Chronic inflammation**: Increase in [[T Cell Mediated Immunity#CD4 Helper|IFN-gamma]]
## Diagnosis
**EIA (enzyme linked immunoassay) test** which which utilizes [[Virology Primer#Detection of anti-virus antibodies|antibody detection]]. This can be confirmed via western blot ([[Virology Primer#Detection of virus proteins (antigens)|antigen detection]]).

This isn't as useful for infants as they hold their mother's antibodies for a year or so. Therefore, [[Virology Primer#Detection of virus genome (PCR)|PCR testing]] is a better solution for those cases.
## Prevention
- Blood donation screening
- Avoid breastfeeding or limit to the first 6 months of life if mother is known to have HTLV infection
- Wrap that shit up boys
## Treatments
Symptom management only.
## HTLV-1 associated acute T-cell leukemia and lymphoma
Lab findings include **peripheral blood cells with “flower cells”**. Will also see high WBC.

- **Generalized lymphadenopathy** 
- **Hypercalcemia** from dysregulation of parathyroid hormone (PTH) 
- **Lytic bone lesions** from dysregulation of parathyroid hormone (PTH) 
- **Skin lesions**: Papules, nodules, or microabscesses (mycosis fungoides from cutaneous infiltration of proliferating cells)
## HTLV associated myelopathy (HAM) and tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP)
Autoimmunity via antigen [[Autoimmunity#Molecular mimicry|mimicry]] as well as direct infection of microglial cells and astrocytes. Associated with blood transfusions.

Exam findings will include stiff gait, spasticity, weakness in extremities, positive Babinski sign, and clonus.

- **Lower back and leg pain** 
- **Urinary symptoms**: Incontinence, impotence
- **Paresthesia**: Pins and needles feeling in extremities
# Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
Transmitted via direct contact either through mucous membranes, needles, transfusions, or mother-to-child transmission.

**Co-occurring STIs increase the risk of acquiring HIV** via sexual contact as they can increase the number of immune cells in mucosal surfaces. This means more targets for HIV.

One of the ways HIV enters the host’s cells is via the **CCR5 receptor**. Because of this, **individuals with defects in CCR5 function have a lower risk of contracting HIV**.
## Pathology
The main target of HIV viral particles is CD4 receptor containing cells.

1. HIV viral particles bind CD4 receptors on dendritic cells in the presence of chemokine receptor CCR5
2. Dendritic cells fuse with [[T Cell Mediated Immunity#CD4 Helper|CD4 T-cells]]
3. Cells replicate

Viral particles are **detectable within 2 days** in the draining internal iliac lymph nodes. They cause destruction of [[T Cell Mediated Immunity#CD4 Helper|CD4 T-cells]] as well as macrophage lineage cells. Inflammation from the infection can also destroy uninfected CD4 cells.
## Diagnosis
Immunoassays (EIA) and western blots are no longer used as antibodies against HIV are formed slowly. Instead, an **HIV RNA test** is used which detects infection less than 1-2 weeks post-infection. An alternative is **4th generation IgM antibody testing plus p24 antigen detection** which is highly sensitive and specific, but requires more time post-infection to return positive (over 2 weeks).

If a follow-up confirmation test is negative, a **nucleic acid amplification assay** should discriminate more properly.
## Phase 1: Dissemination
Associated with positive HIV RNA but negative HIV antibody (**no adaptive immune response yet**). Viral load also increases rapidly but then decreases as the body starts to control viral replication. **This phase is most contagious** because of the increased viral load.

Around 40-90% of patients have symptoms. These can include flu-like symptoms like fever, adenopathy, pharyngitis, rash, myalgia (muscle pain), arthralgia (joint pain), headache, nausea, vomiting, night sweats, and weight loss.
## Phase 2: Latent
Asymptomatic while the virus hibernates in T memory cells. Lasts around 10-years. Over this time, [[T Cell Mediated Immunity#CD4 Helper|CD4 T-cells]] decline at a steady rate.
## Phase 3: AIDS
Eventually, there is a sharp drop-off in CD4 T-cell count when they start losing to viral load and new infections. AIDS kicks in when CD4 T-cell count drops below 200 and more opportunistic infections begin.
## Progression Types
### Typical
After about 8-10 years, either the CD4+ T cells will reach a level below 200 or the individual will start to develop opportunistic infections.
### Rapid
Will progress to AIDS within only a few years, which ultimately results in death
### Long-term survivors
Maintain high CD4+ cell counts for up to 20 years. Eventually they will need therapy.
### Long-term non-progressors
Medical miracles. They have undetectable viral loads for years and maintain elevated levels of CD4 cells persistently.
